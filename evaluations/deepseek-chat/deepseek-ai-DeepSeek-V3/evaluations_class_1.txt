The missing conclusion for Connectify Plus is correctly inferred and added, matching the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "fitTracker_3_0" and "fitTracker_4_0" instead of the more precise "fitness_app_fittracker3.0" and "fitness_app_fittracker4.0". The predicates and their arguments are otherwise correctly instantiated.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing all the key elements of the argument, including the features of both versions of the app and their classification as advanced health tools. The only deviation is the minor semantic issue in variable naming.
Semantics: 4.

Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the slightly awkward phrasing in "opinion_respected_to" and the inconsistent handling of quotes around "colleagues" versus "her own behavior."	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the model's inclusion of "during meetings" in the first predicate where it is not strictly necessary, and the slightly different phrasing of "complains about overuse of technology" versus "complains overuse of technology during meetings." The core argument is correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as "decried lying" vs. "decries lying" and "dismissed deceptions" vs. "dismissed similar deceptions," which slightly deviate from the expected output but do not violate the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the omission of "similar" in "dismissed deceptions" and the use of "his" in "business dealings," but the key elements of the argument are captured correctly.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the slightly awkward phrasing in "opinion_respected_to" predicates and the splitting of phrases like "must be held accountable" and "brushed aside calls" which could be more naturally grouped as in the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the separation of phrases in the predicates and the inclusion of "is_different" and "is_similar" relations, which are correctly identified but could be more precisely aligned with the expected output's phrasing.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the phrasing of "lambasts noisy late-night parties" and "doesn't see an issue" compared to the more precise "criticizes hosting noisy late-night parties" and "doesn't see issue with noisy late-night parties" in the expected output. The model's output also incorrectly places quotes around "residents" in the first premise, which should be a variable without quotes.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the slightly less precise phrasing of opinions and the incorrect quoting of "residents". The key elements of the argument are captured, and the conclusion is correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the slightly awkward phrasing of "opinion_respected_to" and the use of "everyone at the gym" instead of "everyone," which is less precise but still understandable.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the omission of "disciplined" in "flouted workout routine" and the use of "everyone at the gym" instead of "everyone," but the core elements of the argument are correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "defends" instead of "defended" in the second premise, which slightly alters the tense but does not significantly impact the overall meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the essence of the argument and the double standard, with only a minor deviation in verb tense that does not affect the logical structure.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses semantically correct variables like "exercises_regularly(person)" and "physically_fit(person)", but they are more verbose and less abstract than the expected output, which uses simpler terms like "exercise" and "be_fit". The meaning is preserved but with some ambiguity in the level of abstraction.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output correctly reconstructs the missing components, capturing the logical flow from exercising to being physically fit. However, it deviates slightly from the expected output by explicitly including "person" in the predicates, which is not incorrect but less aligned with the expected format. The core argument is complete and accurate.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output correctly captures the general semantic structure of the argument but misrepresents the subject of the investment (company vs. employee_training) and the improvement (employee_performance vs. improved_employee_performance), leading to some ambiguity.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model reconstructs the key components of the argument accurately, though with minor deviations in the representation of the premises and conclusion, such as the inclusion of the company as an explicit actor in the investment, which is not present in the expected output.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output captures the general semantic intent but introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity with nested predicates like `followed_accurately(recipe)` and `turn_out_delicious(dish)`, which are less precise than the expected output's `followed_accurately_recipe` and `make_delicious_dish`.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output correctly reconstructs the argument's structure and conclusion, but the predicates are slightly distorted (e.g., `turn_out_delicious(dish)` vs. `occurs(make_delicious_dish)`), deviating from the expected logical form while still preserving the core meaning.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output correctly captures the general semantics of the enthymeme, but the variable names (e.g., "collaborates_effectively(team)") are less precise and slightly ambiguous compared to the expected output (e.g., "team_collaborate_effectively"). The predicate structure is semantically correct but could be clearer.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output reconstructs the missing components accurately, with the premise and conclusion logically connected. However, the predicate naming and structure deviate slightly from the expected output, which uses more standardized and precise terms (e.g., "occurs(team_achieves_goals)" vs. "achieve(team, goals)"). The logical flow is preserved, but the formulation is less ideal.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses "proper_maintenance" and "runs_smoothly" as predicates, which are semantically close but not as precise as the expected "maintain" and "run_smoothly". The variable "computer_system" is correctly instantiated, but the predicate semantics are slightly ambiguous.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key components (premise and conclusion) correctly, but the structure of the "followed" predicate is less precise than the expected output, which explicitly uses "occurs" for the conclusion. Minor deviations exist, but the overall argument is reconstructed accurately.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there are minor semantic issues such as "gets_enough_sleep" vs. "get_enough_sleep" and "feels_more_focused" vs. "feel_more_focused," which slightly deviate from the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 3. Justification: The key elements of the argument are captured, but the model's output incorrectly uses "followed" instead of "followed" and omits the "occurs" predicate for the conclusion, leading to a distorted representation.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "rains" and "streets" should be singular ("rain" and "street") to match the expected output, indicating minor semantic issues.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the logical relationship and conclusion correctly, despite the minor semantic deviation.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there is a minor semantic issue with "occured" (misspelled as "occured" instead of "occurred") and "followed" (misspelled as "followed" instead of "follows"). The predicates "attends" and "improves" are correctly instantiated but could be more precise in tense ("attend" vs. "attends", "improve" vs. "improves").	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but there are minor deviations in the predicates and their tense usage. The structure of the argument is correctly reconstructed, but the model's output uses "improves" instead of "improve" and "followed" instead of "follows", which slightly deviates from the expected output. The conclusion is correctly identified but not fully aligned with the expected tense.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there is a minor semantic issue with "smoother(traffic_flow)" which should be "occurs(smooth_traffic_flow)" to better match the expected output and clarify the state of traffic flow.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the missing "occurs" predicate in the conclusion and the slightly different predicate naming ("well_maintained(road)" vs. "well_maintained_road"). The overall structure and logic are correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output captures the general semantics of the argument but uses less precise variable names (e.g., "individual" instead of "someone") and predicates (e.g., "got_sufficient_sleep" instead of "gets(someone,enough_sleep)"), introducing minor ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output reconstructs the argument's structure and components accurately, though with slight deviations in predicate and variable naming compared to the expected output. The logical flow and key elements are preserved.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "brighter_streetlights" is slightly less precise than "brighter_street_lights" (hyphenated), which could introduce minor ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key premises and conclusion accurately, but it omits the implicit premise "not_too_costly(city,brighter_street_lights)," which is a minor deviation from the expected output.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly in terms of semantic clarity and type correctness.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, including the inferred premise (not_too_costly) and the conclusion, aligning perfectly with the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables and predicates in the model's output are mostly well-defined and semantically correct, though "reusable_bags" could be more precisely instantiated as "more_reusable_bags" to better match the intended meaning of increasing usage.  	Correctness/Completeness: 3. Justification: The model's output captures the key elements of the argument but misses the implicit premise "not_too_costly(shoppers,more_reusable_bags)," which is necessary for a complete reconstruction of the practical reasoning scheme.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with clear and correct semantic mappings (e.g., "would_help", "can_carry_out", "ought_to_carry_out" accurately reflect the natural language meaning).  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key premises and conclusion accurately but omits the minor premise "not_too_costly(teachers,clear_instructions)", which is part of the expected normative reasoning structure. The reconstruction is otherwise faithful.

Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the intended meaning and type of the natural language enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model missed the implicit premise "not_too_costly(doctors,regular_check_ups)," which is a minor deviation from the expected output.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities in the predicates or arguments.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model's output misses the implicit premise "not_too_costly(municipalities,improved_signage)" which is necessary for the full reconstruction of the argument.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there is a minor semantic issue with "early_education_programs" in the model's output, which should be "early_education" to match the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model incorrectly uses "early_education_programs" instead of "early_education" in two predicates, deviating slightly from the expected output.

Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, including the inferred premise (not_too_costly) and the conclusion, aligning perfectly with the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "resolve_conflicts" is slightly less precise than the expected "conflicts," which could introduce minor ambiguity about whether the predicate refers to the state of conflicts or the action of resolving them.

Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "bring_about(increased_investment(research_and_development))" is slightly less precise than the expected "invest(research_development)", introducing minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the reconstructed premise uses a more verbose predicate ("bring_about(increased_investment(...))") instead of the simpler and expected "invest(...)", which is a minor deviation.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "advancing_economic_prosperity" is less precise than "pursue(economic_prosperity)" in capturing the intended meaning of the original enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed accurately, with the necessary condition and conclusion correctly inferred and formatted. The minor semantic deviation does not affect the logical completeness.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "improve(healthcare)" could be more precisely instantiated as "pursue(improving,healthcare)" to better reflect the ongoing nature of the goal. Additionally, "expand(healthcare_infrastructure)" is semantically close but not identical to the expected "invest(healthcare_infrastructure)."	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key elements of the argument, including the goal and the necessary condition, but slightly deviates in the predicate used for the action on healthcare infrastructure ("expand" vs. "invest"). The structure and logic are otherwise correct.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "strive_for" instead of "strive" which slightly deviates from the expected output but does not significantly alter the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the goal and necessary condition as specified in the expected output. The minor deviation in predicate naming does not affect the overall correctness or completeness of the argument.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic issues. The predicates and their arguments correctly reflect the intended meaning of the natural language enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, with only a minor deviation in the pluralization of "protocol" (expected: "protocol", model output: "protocols"). This does not significantly distort the argument's meaning.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with clear and accurate semantic mappings to the natural language enthymeme (e.g., "advocate(sustainable_tech_practices)" and "promote(energy_efficient_computing)" correctly reflect the intended meaning).  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the logical structure of the enthymeme (goal and necessary condition) without deviations or omissions.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "invest_in_smart_irrigation" is less precise than "invest(smart_irrigation)" in the expected output, introducing minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the predicate "invest_in_smart_irrigation" is slightly deviated from the expected "invest(smart_irrigation)", though the overall meaning is preserved.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output uses "encourage_creativity" and "find_inspiration" as atomic predicates, which slightly deviates from the expected nested predicate structure (e.g., "encourage(creativity)"). This creates minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the logical relationship between the goal and the necessary condition. The only deviation is syntactic (atomic vs. nested predicates), not affecting correctness.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "play_soccer" could be more precisely instantiated as "play(soccer)" to match the expected output, avoiding minor ambiguity in the predicate structure.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the goal and necessary condition accurately. The deviation in predicate naming ("play_soccer" vs. "play(soccer)") is minor and does not affect logical correctness.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, but there is a minor semantic issue with "play_chess" and "review_chess_theory" being treated as single terms rather than structured predicates like "play(chess)" and "review(chess_theory)" in the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the necessary condition and goal correctly, though the predicate structure slightly deviates from the expected format.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure and conclusion.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the predicate "subset" is used instead of the more precise "subset_of," which introduces a minor semantic ambiguity.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the argument's structure and missing elements, with only a minor deviation in predicate naming.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the use of "all_eukaryotic_cells" as a single term instead of "eukaryotic_cells" introduces a minor semantic issue, as it slightly deviates from the expected natural language interpretation.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model's output incorrectly uses "all_eukaryotic_cells" as a single term, which is a minor deviation from the expected output. The structure and logic of the argument are otherwise correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the predicate "unicellular_microorganisms(bacterias)" is less precise than the expected "be(bacterias,unicellular_microorganisms)", which better captures the intended semantic relationship.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the predicate "contain(microbiology,unicellular_microorganisms(bacterias))" slightly deviates from the expected "contain(microbiology,be(bacterias,unicellular_microorganisms))", which more precisely represents the knowledge domain.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure and conclusion.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly. The predicates and their arguments are correctly defined and semantically aligned with the natural language enthymeme.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure and missing components as per the expected output. There are no deviations or missing elements.

Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure without deviations.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "architecture" should be "architecture_design" to precisely match the intended meaning in the enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the expected output includes an additional empty list element, which the model missed, indicating a minor deviation.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly in terms of semantic clarity and type correctness.
