Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output uses "NimbusBook" and "NimbusBook_Pro" instead of the more precise "laptop_nimbusbook" and "laptop_nimbusbook_pro," which slightly deviates from the expected semantic clarity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, including the inferred conclusion about the NimbusBook Pro, which aligns perfectly with the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, but the omission of "fitness_tracker_" prefix in the predicates slightly deviates from the expected semantic clarity, introducing minor ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are accurately reconstructed, including the implicit conclusion about PulseFit X, with no missing or distorted elements. The deviation in variable naming does not affect logical fidelity.
Semantics: 4. Justification: Variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as inconsistent capitalization ("Vortex" vs "vortex") which does not affect the overall meaning but deviates from the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: Components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing all key elements of the argument without any missing or distorted parts. The only deviation is the capitalization, which does not impact the logical structure or correctness.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output simplifies "a variety of eco-friendly wash cycles" to "eco_friendly_wash_cycles," losing some semantic nuance present in the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output correctly reconstructs the missing conclusion for EcoWash Plus and captures the key elements of the argument, but it slightly deviates by not fully specifying the variety of eco-friendly wash cycles as in the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the inconsistent use of "novaTab" vs. "tablet_novatab" and "AMOLED" vs. "amoled," which slightly deviate from the expected output but do not violate the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing all key elements of the argument, including the features and classification of both tablets, with no missing or distorted components.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, but the use of "titan_x" and "titan_x_pro" instead of "smartphone_titanx" and "smartphone_titanx_pro" introduces minor semantic ambiguity regarding the type of entity being referenced.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the features and classification of both smartphone models, including the inferred conclusion about the Titan X Pro. The only deviation is the naming convention, which does not affect the logical correctness or completeness of the argument.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of underscores in "smartwatch_ChronoFit_3" instead of the expected "smartwatch_chronofit3", but the meaning remains clear and unambiguous.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing all premises and the conclusion, including the implicit conclusion about the ChronoFit 3 Pro.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output uses simplified terms ("connectify" and "connectify_plus") instead of the more precise "social_media_platform_connectify" and "social_media_platform_connectifyplus" from the expected output, leading to minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the features and classification accurately, with no missing or distorted elements. The only deviation is the variable naming, which does not affect the logical correctness.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output uses underscores inconsistently (e.g., "real-time_workout_tracking" vs. "real_time_workout_tracking") and omits the "fitness_app_" prefix for the app names, which slightly deviates from the expected semantic clarity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, including the inferred conclusion about FitTracker 4.0, which aligns perfectly with the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "coffee_machine_BrewMaster" instead of "coffee_machine_model_brewmaster" and "coffee_machine_BrewMaster_Elite" instead of "coffee_machine_model_brewmaster_elite". These deviations do not significantly alter the intended meaning but are not fully precise.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing all key elements of the argument, including the features of both coffee machine models and the classification as premium brewing devices. The only deviations are in the naming conventions, which do not affect the logical structure or completeness of the argument.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "criticizes_micromanagement" and "defends_scrutinizing_every_minor_detail" which are not as precise as the expected output's natural language equivalents. The types and intended meanings are generally preserved but lack clarity.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the use of abstract predicates instead of the exact natural language phrases from the enthymeme. The structure and logic of the argument are correctly reconstructed, but the fidelity to the original text is slightly compromised.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "argues_strict_bedtimes_are_unfair" and "enforces_strict_bedtimes" which are not as precise as the expected output's natural-language quotations. The types are generally respected, but the semantics could be clearer.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the phrasing of the opinions and the lack of quotation marks around the natural-language statements. The structure and logic of the argument are correctly captured, but the exact wording of the premises is not fully aligned with the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, but there are minor semantic issues such as the use of underscores instead of spaces in predicates (e.g., "condemns_plagiarism" vs. "condemns plagiarism") and the lack of quotation marks around string literals, which slightly affects clarity.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the intended meaning of the enthymeme. All key elements are present, including the double standard in Emily's behavior, and there are no significant deviations from the expected output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model's output lacks quotation marks around string literals, which could lead to minor semantic ambiguity in distinguishing predicates from constants.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are accurately reconstructed with high fidelity, capturing the intended meaning and structure of the enthymeme without any missing or distorted elements.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "complains_about_overuse_of_technology" and "excuses_overuse_of_technology" which are not as precisely instantiated as in the expected output (e.g., missing "during meetings" and "frequent phone-checking" details). The terms "colleagues" and "herself" are correctly instantiated but lack the clarity of "her own behavior" in the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, capturing the key elements of Linda's double standard. However, the predicates are slightly distorted (e.g., "excuses_overuse_of_technology" instead of "excuses frequent phone-checking"), and the phrasing of the opinions lacks the specificity of the expected output. Minor deviations prevent a full score.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there are minor semantic issues such as the use of "condemns_lying" and "dismisses_lying" instead of the more precise "decries lying" and "dismissed similar deceptions" from the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the phrasing of the predicates and the omission of quotation marks around the natural language terms, which slightly affects fidelity.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "opinion_respected_to" and the use of compound terms (e.g., "large_corporations_for_waste_management") instead of natural language phrases, which slightly deviates from the expected clarity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, capturing the key elements of the argument, but the reconstruction replaces natural language phrases with compound terms, introducing minor deviations from the expected output.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "criticizes_noisy_parties" and "other_residents_noisy_parties" which are not as precise as the expected output's natural-language equivalents. The model's variables are loosely related but lack the clarity of the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the lack of quotation marks around natural-language phrases and the use of abbreviated predicates. The structure and logic of the argument are correctly reconstructed, but the phrasing is not as precise as the expected output.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "demands_disciplined_workout_routine" and "flouted_disciplined_workout_routine" which are not as precise as the expected output's direct quotes. The terms "others" and "everyone" also introduce minor semantic looseness.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate and complete, capturing the key elements of the argument. However, the predicates are slightly distorted (e.g., "demands_disciplined_workout_routine" vs. the expected "should stick to a disciplined workout routine"), and the term "others" is less precise than "everyone." These are minor deviations from the expected output.
Semantics: 3. Justification: Most variables are semantically correct, but there is ambiguity in the predicates like "condemns_aggressive_marketing_tactics" and "defends_employing_same_strategies" being treated as atomic terms rather than natural-language strings, which slightly deviates from the expected output's clarity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, capturing the key elements of the argument, but the predicates are not fully aligned with the natural-language phrasing in the expected output, leading to minor deviations.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses variables like "exercises_regularly(person)" and "is_physically_fit(person)", which are semantically correct but slightly more verbose and less abstract than the expected output's "exercise" and "be_fit". The meaning is preserved, but the instantiation is less concise.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output correctly reconstructs the premises and conclusion, capturing the logical flow from exercising to being physically fit. However, it deviates slightly from the expected output's more abstract representation, which uses simpler predicates like "exercise" and "be_fit" without the explicit "person" argument. The core components are accurate, but the form is not identical.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output correctly captures the general structure of the argument but introduces variables like "company" and "employee_performance" in a way that is less precise than the expected output. The semantics are mostly correct but slightly ambiguous due to the broader instantiation of variables.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output accurately reconstructs the argument's components, including the premise and conclusion, with only minor deviations in the formulation of predicates (e.g., "improves(company, employee_performance)" vs. "occurs(improved_employee_performance)"). The core logic is preserved, but the phrasing is not identical to the expected output.
Semantics: 2. Justification: The model's output uses variables like "delicious(dish)" which are loosely related to the intended meaning and do not precisely capture the semantic relationship between following the recipe and the dish turning out delicious. The expected output uses more semantically precise terms like "occurs(make_delicious_dish)".	Correctness/Completeness: 3. Justification: The model's output captures the key elements of the argument (following the recipe leads to a delicious dish) but distorts the logical structure by nesting predicates incorrectly (e.g., "followed(occured(follows(recipe, accurately)), delicious(dish))"). The expected output correctly reconstructs the components with proper nesting and clarity.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses predicates like "collaborates(team, effectively)" and "achieves(team, goals)", which are semantically close to the expected output but less precise in variable naming (e.g., "team_collaborate_effectively" is clearer than "collaborates(team, effectively)"). There is some ambiguity in the predicate structure.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model correctly reconstructs the argument's structure and captures the logical flow from collaboration to goal achievement. However, the predicate naming and structure deviate slightly from the expected output, which uses more standardized and explicit variable names (e.g., "team_achieves_goals" vs. "achieves(team, goals)"). The components are mostly accurate but not perfectly aligned.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses predicates like "maintained" and "runs_smoothly" which are semantically close but not identical to the expected "maintain" and "run_smoothly". The variable "computer_system" is correctly instantiated, but the predicate semantics are slightly ambiguous due to tense and form deviations.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key logical structure and components of the argument, including the premise and conclusion. However, it deviates slightly in predicate formulation (e.g., "runs_smoothly" vs. "run_smoothly") and lacks the "occurs" wrapper in the conclusion, which are minor inaccuracies.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses variables and predicates that are semantically close to the expected output, but there are some ambiguities (e.g., "gets(person,enough_sleep)" vs. "get_enough_sleep(person)") and minor deviations in structure (e.g., "feels(person,more_focused)" vs. "feel_more_focused(person)").  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model correctly reconstructs the logical structure and captures the key components of the argument, but there are minor deviations in predicate formulation (e.g., "followed(...)" vs. "occurs(...)") and missing the explicit "occurs" wrapper for the conclusion in the model's output.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, with minor semantic issues such as "rains" instead of "rain" and "streets" instead of "street," which slightly deviate from the expected singular form but do not violate the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the logical structure and conclusion of the enthymeme, despite the minor semantic deviations.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined, but there are minor semantic issues such as the use of "attends_classes_regularly(student)" instead of the more precise "attend(student,classes_regularly)" and "improves_academic_performance(student)" instead of "improve(student,academic_performance)".	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components of the argument are mostly accurate with only minor deviations from the expected output, such as the structure of the predicates and the use of "followed" instead of "occurs" in the conclusion. However, the overall argument is correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses semantically correct variables but introduces ambiguity with nested predicates like "smoother(traffic_flow)" instead of the clearer "occurs(smooth_traffic_flow)" in the expected output. The meaning is preserved but less precise.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model reconstructs the key components accurately, but the nested structure and missing "occurs" in the conclusion slightly deviate from the expected output. The logical flow is mostly preserved.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output correctly captures the main variables (individual, sufficient_sleep, cognitive_performance) but uses slightly different predicates (e.g., "got" instead of "gets", "improves" instead of "occurs(improves)"), leading to minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model reconstructs the key components accurately, including the premise and conclusion, but deviates slightly in predicate structure (e.g., missing "occurs" wrapper for the conclusion). The logical flow is preserved, with only minor formal inconsistencies.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "brighter_streetlights" instead of "brighter_street_lights," which is a minor inconsistency but does not significantly impact the overall meaning.

Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the premises and correctly inferring the missing conclusion.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "reusable_bags" should be "more_reusable_bags" to accurately reflect the intended meaning of increasing usage, which is a minor semantic issue.

Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the premises and inferred conclusion without deviations.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the model incorrectly instantiated "early_education_programs" instead of "early_education" in the predicates, which introduces a minor semantic deviation from the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model's use of "early_education_programs" instead of "early_education" in the premises is a minor deviation from the expected output, affecting fidelity.

Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the logical structure and relationships accurately despite the minor semantic deviation in variable forms.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic ambiguity or incorrect type usage.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with "whale," "mammal," and "killer_whale" correctly reflecting the intended meaning and types from the enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing both premises and the conclusion exactly as expected.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic ambiguity or incorrect type usage.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of plural forms ("bicycles", "vehicles") instead of singular ("bicycle", "vehicle"), which slightly deviates from the expected output but does not violate the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, accurately capturing the logical structure and relationships of the enthymeme, despite the minor semantic deviations in variable forms.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the capitalization of "iPhone" which does not affect the overall meaning but deviates from the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing the logical relationship accurately despite the minor formatting discrepancy.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities. The predicates and terms (e.g., "bring_about(technological_innovation)", "invest(research_and_development)") are correctly defined and match the intended meaning of the enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, with only a minor deviation in the predicate "research_and_development" (expected: "research_development"). This does not affect the logical structure or fidelity of the reconstruction.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the inclusion of "advancements" in the predicate "pursue(advancements,economic_prosperity)" introduces a minor semantic issue, as it is not present in the expected output and slightly deviates from the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, with the main structure of the argument correctly reconstructed. However, the addition of "advancements" in the predicate is a minor deviation from the expected output, affecting completeness slightly.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "improve(healthcare)" could be more precisely instantiated as "pursue(improving,healthcare)" to better reflect the ongoing nature of the goal. Additionally, "expand(healthcare_infrastructure)" is semantically close but not identical to the expected "invest(healthcare_infrastructure)."	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key elements of the argument, including the goal and the necessary condition, but the predicates "expand" and "invest" are not perfectly aligned, and the structure of the goal could be more accurately represented as in the expected output. Minor deviations exist, but the core components are correctly reconstructed.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "pursue" is used instead of "strive," which slightly deviates from the intended meaning of the original enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are accurately reconstructed with high fidelity, including the goal and necessary condition, despite the minor semantic deviation in the predicate.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic ambiguity or incorrect type usage. The model's output matches the expected output in terms of variable instantiation and meaning.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only a minor deviation (pluralization of "protocol" in the model's output, which does not affect logical correctness but slightly deviates from the expected form).
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables in the model's output are mostly well-defined and semantically correct, but there is a minor issue with the instantiation of predicates (e.g., "advocating_for_sustainable_tech_practices" vs. "advocate(sustainable_tech_practices)"), which slightly deviates from the expected output.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key components accurately, but the predicates are not fully decomposed as in the expected output (e.g., "promoting_energy_efficient_computing" vs. "promote(energy_efficient_computing)"), resulting in minor deviations.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "pursue(farming)" is slightly less precise than the expected "farming," introducing minor ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high fidelity, capturing the goal and necessary condition accurately despite the minor semantic deviation.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but there is a minor semantic issue with "encourage_creativity" and "find_inspiration" being treated as single terms rather than predicates with arguments, which slightly deviates from the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations, such as the lack of parentheses to separate predicates and their arguments, but the overall structure and meaning are preserved.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but "train(hard)" is slightly less precise than the expected "train_hard," introducing minor semantic ambiguity.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: All components are reconstructed with high fidelity, capturing the goal, necessary condition, and conclusion accurately. The deviation in predicate naming ("train(hard)" vs. "train_hard") does not affect logical correctness.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities. The predicates and their arguments correctly reflect the intended meaning of the natural language enthymeme.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly. No elements are missing or distorted.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output captures the general idea but has some semantic ambiguities, such as using "health" instead of "medicine" and "exercising_is_healthy" instead of "healthy(exercising)", which are less precise.  	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model reconstructs the key components accurately but deviates slightly in predicate structure (e.g., "exercising_is_healthy" vs. "healthy(exercising)"). The overall argument scheme is preserved.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined with minor semantic issues, such as the use of "is_subset" instead of "subset_of," which slightly deviates from the expected predicate but does not violate the intended meaning.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, capturing all key elements of the argument accurately, despite the minor semantic deviation in the predicate name.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output uses a predicate "all_eukaryotic_cells_have_mitochondria" which is semantically correct but less precise than the expected "have(eukaryotic_cells,mitochondria)". The variables are mostly well-defined but the predicate lacks the clarity of the expected output.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model's output captures the key elements of the argument, including Emily's position and assertion, but the predicate structure is slightly less accurate than the expected output. The components are mostly accurate with only minor deviations in predicate formulation.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure and missing elements.
Semantics: 4. Justification: The variables are mostly well-defined, but the predicate "bacterias_are_unicellular_microorganisms" is not as precise as the expected "be(bacterias,unicellular_microorganisms)", introducing minor semantic ambiguity.	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The components are mostly accurate, but the model's output combines the predicate into a single term rather than separating it into a relation and its arguments, which is a minor deviation from the expected output.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure and conclusion.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, with no semantic violations or ambiguities. The predicates and their arguments correctly reflect the intended meaning of the natural language enthymeme.	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, matching the expected output exactly. No elements are missing or distorted, and the argument is complete.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly in terms of semantic clarity and type correctness.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure without any deviations or omissions.
Semantics: 3. Justification: The model's output correctly identifies Mark's position and assertion but misrepresents the predicate "form_follows_function" as a single term rather than the relational "follows(form,function)". The domain "architecture" is also less precise than "architecture_design".	Correctness/Completeness: 4. Justification: The model captures the core components (Mark's expertise, assertion, and conclusion) but misses the relational structure of "follows(form,function)" and slightly deviates in domain specificity. No major elements are missing.
Semantics: 5. Justification: All variables are precisely and unambiguously instantiated, matching the expected output exactly.  	Correctness/Completeness: 5. Justification: The components are reconstructed with high precision and fidelity, fully capturing the intended argument structure.
