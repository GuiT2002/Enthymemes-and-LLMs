Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. Let me start by understanding the task thoroughly.

First, the text given is: "In a competitive hiring process, Susan submitted a cover letter filled with vague generalities without backing them up with measurable accomplishments." This is the enthymeme where either the conclusion or some premises might be missing. My job is to figure out which argumentation scheme this belongs to and then instantiate all the variables and predicates accordingly.

Looking at the context provided, there are several argumentation schemes. Let's review each one to see which fits the text.

1. **Analogy based on Classification**: This involves features and classification. The example talks about two smartphones with similar features being classified the same. The text here doesn't compare two entities based on features but rather points out a problem with vagueness. Probably not this one.

2. **Effect to Cause**: This is about events leading to outcomes. The example mentions providing customer service leading to increased satisfaction. The text here isn't about causation between events. Not this scheme.

3. **Need for Help**: This involves helping actions that are feasible and not costly. The text isn't suggesting an action to help someone. Doesn't fit.

4. **Argument from Opposites**: This involves properties of opposites. The example uses fire and ice. The text here isn't about opposites. Not applicable.

5. **Moral Justification Ad Populum**: This is about what everyone who is Y accepts. The example involves compassion and forgiveness. The text isn't about moral acceptance by a group. Not this.

6. **Classification Argumentation**: This is straightforward classification. Example: Eagles are birds, so white eagles are birds. The text doesn't classify Susan's cover letter into a category but points out a flaw. Not this.

7. **Necessary Condition**: Relates goals to necessary actions. Example: Investing in solar power is necessary for renewable energy goals. The text isn't about goals and necessary conditions. Doesn't fit.

8. **Position to Know**: Relies on authority. Example: A meteorologist's claim about weather. The text doesn't involve an authority figure. Not this.

9. **Double Standard**: Involves applying different standards to similar situations. Example: Julia demanding impartiality but dismissing it for herself. The text doesn't mention differing standards applied by the same person. Hmm, maybe not.

10. **Vagueness of a Verbal Classification**: This scheme deals with vague properties in contexts requiring precision. The example is John's report with ambiguous descriptors in a context needing clarity. The user's text mentions a cover letter with vague generalities in a competitive hiring process, which likely requires specific accomplishments. This seems to fit perfectly.

Now, mapping the text to the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme:

The scheme structure is:
[has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y).

Breaking down the text:
- **Y**: Susan's cover letter. Let's denote this as 'susan_cover_letter'.
- **F**: The property is 'vague_generalities' (since the letter is filled with vague generalities without measurable accomplishments).
- **PL**: The vague property is problematic for 'measurable_accomplishments' or 'specificity'—since the hiring process requires measurable accomplishments. But looking at the example, the vague_for predicate links the property to the required parameter. In the example, 'ambiguous_descriptors' are vague_for 'clarity_precision'. Here, 'vague_generalities' might be vague_for 'specific_measurable_accomplishments' or similar. Let's check the example again. The example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as F and 'clarity_precision' as PL. So in our case, maybe 'vague_generalities' are vague for 'specific_measurable_accomplishments'. But perhaps more accurately, the required context is 'specific_measurable_accomplishments' because the hiring process requires that. Wait, the example's PL is 'clarity_precision', and the context is 'high-stakes evaluations' which require that. Similarly, the user's text mentions a 'competitive hiring process' which requires 'measurable accomplishments' (specific and clear evidence). So maybe 'specific_measurable_accomplishments' is the PL here. But the exact term might need to align with the example's structure.

Alternatively, the example's PL is 'clarity_precision', so maybe in this case, the PL is 'specificity_and_measurability' or similar. Let's see. The example's 'vague_for(F, PL)' links the vague property to the parameter that's required. So in the user's case, the cover letter's vagueness is problematic because the context (competitive hiring process) requires specific, measurable accomplishments. Therefore, the PL would be the parameter that is lacking, which is 'specific_measurable_accomplishments'. However, the example uses 'clarity_precision' as PL. To mirror that structure, perhaps 'clarity_and_specificity' or similar.

But I need to use the exact predicates as per the example. The example has 'vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision)'. So 'ambiguous_descriptors' is the F, and 'clarity_precision' is the PL. Similarly, in the user's case, the vague generalities (F) are vague for something like 'clarity_and_measurable_evidence' (PL). But maybe the PL is 'specific_measurable_accomplishments' or just 'measurable_accomplishments'. Let's check the text again. The problem is that the cover letter has vague generalities without backing them up with measurable accomplishments. So the context requires measurable accomplishments. Therefore, the PL here is 'measurable_accomplishments', and the vague property (F) is 'vague_generalities', which is vague for that PL.

So:

has_property(susan_cover_letter, vague_generalities)

vague_for(vague_generalities, measurable_accomplishments)

occurs_in(susan_cover_letter, context_that_requires(measurable_accomplishments))

Therefore, the conclusion is should_be_rejected(susan_cover_letter)

Putting it all together:

[has_property(susan_cover_letter, vague_generalities), vague_for(vague_generalities, measurable_accomplishments), occurs_in(susan_cover_letter, context_that_requires(measurable_accomplishments))], should_be_rejected(susan_cover_letter)

I need to ensure that the predicates and arguments match the scheme exactly. Let's cross-check with the example:

Example 1: [has_property(john_report, ambiguous_descriptors), vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision), occurs_in(john_report, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))], should_be_rejected(john_report)

Yes, the structure is the same. So in this case, 'vague_generalities' is the F, 'measurable_accomplishments' is the PL (since the context requires them), and the context is a competitive hiring process which requires measurable accomplishments. Therefore, the occurs_in predicate would be that the cover letter occurs in a context requiring measurable accomplishments.

Therefore, the computational form should be:

[has_property(susan_cover_letter, vague_generalities), vague_for(vague_generalities, measurable_accomplishments), occurs_in(susan_cover_letter, context_that_requires(measurable_accomplishments))], should_be_rejected(susan_cover_letter)

I need to ensure that all variables are instantiated correctly. The text mentions "competitive hiring process" as the context, which requires measurable accomplishments. So the context_that_requires(measurable_accomplishments) is correct. The property of the cover letter is 'vague generalities', which is vague for 'measurable accomplishments'. That makes sense because the hiring process requires specifics, but the letter has vague statements instead. Thus, the argument is that since the cover letter has vague generalities (which are vague in the context requiring measurable accomplishments), it should be rejected.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an argument in natural language and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context given. The text is: "During the grant review, Dr. Martin's research proposal was littered with imprecise phrasing that failed to quantify results."

First, I need to figure out which argumentation scheme this belongs to. Let's look at the context examples.

The context lists several schemes like Analogy based on Classification, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Argument from Opposites, Moral Justification Ad Populum, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness of a Verbal Classification, etc.

The example given for Vagueness of a Verbal Classification is about John's report being rejected because it had ambiguous descriptors, which are vague in a context requiring clarity and precision. The structure here is: [has_property(Y,F), vague_for(F,PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y).

Now, the text in question mentions Dr. Martin's proposal having "imprecise phrasing that failed to quantify results." Imprecise phrasing sounds like a vague or ambiguous property. The context is a grant review, which would require precise and quantifiable results. So this seems to fit the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme.

Breaking down the elements:

- Y (the subject) is Dr. Martin's research proposal. Let's name that 'dr_martin_proposal'.
- F (the property) is imprecise_phrasing. The text says "littered with imprecise phrasing."
- PL (the parameter of vagueness) would be quantification or precise_results, since the proposal failed to quantify results. The context that requires this is grant reviews, which need quantifiable data.
- The occurs_in predicate would place the proposal in a context requiring quantification/precision.

Putting it all together:

has_property(dr_martin_proposal, imprecise_phrasing)
vague_for(imprecise_phrasing, quantification)
occurs_in(dr_martin_proposal, context_that_requires(quantification))

Therefore, should_be_rejected(dr_martin_proposal)

I need to check if all variables are instantiated correctly. The predicates match the scheme: has_property(Y,F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL)). The conclusion is should_be_rejected(Y).

Yes, this fits. The example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' and 'clarity_precision', but here the vague property is imprecise phrasing affecting quantification. The context requiring PL (quantification) is the grant review. So the computational form should be:

[has_property(dr_martin_proposal, imprecise_phrasing), vague_for(imprecise_phrasing, quantification), occurs_in(dr_martin_proposal, context_that_requires(quantification))], should_be_rejected(dr_martin_proposal)

Wait, the original example uses 'ambiguous_descriptors' and 'clarity_precision', but here the terms might need to be adjusted. Let me check the exact wording. The proposal failed to quantify results, so maybe 'quantifiable_results' is the PL. Let me adjust:

Maybe the vague property is 'imprecise_phrasing' and it's vague for 'quantifiable_results'. The context that requires quantifiable results is the grant review. So:

has_property(dr_martin_proposal, imprecise_phrasing)
vague_for(imprecise_phrasing, quantifiable_results)
occurs_in(dr_martin_proposal, context_that_requires(quantifiable_results))

Therefore, conclusion is should_be_rejected(dr_martin_proposal).

Yes, that makes sense. The original example's PL was 'clarity_precision', but here the required PL is 'quantifiable_results'. So the final answer should follow this structure.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to translate the given natural language argument into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the provided context. The text is an enthymeme, which means some parts might be missing, so I need to infer those based on the examples given.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme the given text belongs to. Let's read the text again: "A new dish on a high-end restaurant’s menu was described using flowery adjectives that omitted key ingredients and preparation details." 

The key points here are that the description is vague (flowery adjectives, omitted details) and that this occurs in a context where specifics are important (a high-end restaurant's menu, which likely requires precise information for customers). This reminds me of the "Vagueness of a Verbal Classification" scheme. Let's check the example provided for that scheme.

In the example, John's report was rejected because it had ambiguous descriptors in a context that required clarity and precision. The structure was: has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL)), leading to should_be_rejected(Y).

Comparing that to the text: The new dish's description has flowery adjectives (which are vague) and omits key details. The context is a high-end restaurant menu, which probably requires clear and precise information (like ingredients and preparation details for dietary or allergy concerns, or customer expectations). So the vague property (flowery adjectives) is problematic in a context needing specificity.

Variables and predicates to instantiate would be:
- Y: the new dish's description (let's call it new_dish_description)
- F: flowery_adjectives_omitting_details
- PL: clarity_specificity (since the context requires specifics)
- The context is the high-end restaurant menu, which requires clarity and specificity.

Putting it all together:
has_property(new_dish_description, flowery_adjectives_omitting_details)
vague_for(flowery_adjectives_omitting_details, clarity_specificity)
occurs_in(new_dish_description, context_that_requires(clarity_specificity))
Therefore, should_be_rejected(new_dish_description)

Checking the example again to ensure the structure matches. The predicates and their order must align. Yes, the example uses has_property, vague_for, occurs_in, and concludes should_be_rejected. This matches the given text's structure once the variables are substituted correctly. The key is that the vague feature is in a context that requires the opposite, leading to rejection.


Okay, let's see. The user provided an argument in natural language and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. The text is about Carlos entering a university essay contest with a paper that used loosely defined concepts without solid explanations.

First, I need to recall the different argumentation schemes provided. The example given for the "Vagueness of a Verbal Classification" scheme involves a report with ambiguous descriptors being rejected because the context requires clarity. The structure there was [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y).

Looking at the text: Carlos's paper has loosely defined concepts (which is a property of the paper), and the contest context probably requires clear definitions. The argument is that because the paper is vague in a context that needs precision, it should be rejected. So, mapping this to the scheme:

- Y is carlos_paper
- F is loosely_defined_concepts
- PL (the property that F is vague for) would be clarity_precision or something similar, as in the example.
- The context is the university essay contest, which requires clear explanations (context_that_requires(clarity_precision)).

So the predicates would be:
has_property(carlos_paper, loosely_defined_concepts)
vague_for(loosely_defined_concepts, clarity_precision)
occurs_in(carlos_paper, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))
Therefore, should_be_rejected(carlos_paper)

I need to check if there's another scheme this could fit into. The other schemes like Classification or Analogy don't seem to fit here. The example about John's report being rejected due to ambiguity is very similar. So this is definitely the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme.


Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to analyze the given text and map it to one of the provided argumentation schemes. The text is an enthymeme, so parts might be missing, and I need to infer the missing components based on the context examples.

The text provided is: "In a city planning review, an architectural design proposal contained ambiguous references without detailing structural parameters."

Looking at the context examples, there are several argumentation schemes. Let me go through each to see which fits.

First, the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification Argumentation scheme. The example given involved a report with ambiguous descriptors in a context requiring clarity, leading to the conclusion that the report should be rejected. The scheme is [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y).

In the given text, the architectural design proposal has ambiguous references (which is the property F) and occurs in a city planning review (the context that requires certain parameters, which would be PL here). Since city planning reviews need detailed structural parameters, the vague references are problematic. This seems to fit the vagueness scheme.

Let me check the other schemes to be sure. The Classification scheme involves hierarchical classification, like eagles being birds. The example here isn't about classification but about vagueness in a required context. The Double Standard involves differing opinions on similar things, which isn't present here. The Moral Justification Ad Populum relates to what others accept, which also doesn't fit. The Necessary Condition is about goals and prerequisites, which isn't the case here. The Position to Know is about authority, which also doesn't apply. The Effect to Cause is about events leading to outcomes, which isn't matching. The Argument from Opposites is about opposite properties, which doesn't fit. The Need for Help is about actions to take, which isn't relevant. The Analogy based on Classification is about similar features leading to same classification, which also doesn't apply here.

So the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification is the right fit. Now, I need to instantiate the variables. 

The entity Y is the architectural design proposal. The property F is ambiguous references. PL (the parameter that's vague) would be structural_parameters, since the proposal lacks detailing structural parameters. The context is city planning review, which requires structural parameters (context_that_requires(structural_parameters)).

Putting it all together:

has_property(architectural_design_proposal, ambiguous_references)
vague_for(ambiguous_references, structural_parameters)
occurs_in(architectural_design_proposal, context_that_requires(structural_parameters))
Therefore, should_be_rejected(architectural_design_proposal)

I need to make sure the predicates match the scheme exactly. The original example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' and 'clarity_precision', but here the ambiguous references are vague for structural parameters. The context is a city planning review which requires structural parameters, so occurs_in Y in that context.

Yes, this fits. The final answer should be the computational representation in the specified format.


Okay, let's try to figure out which argumentation scheme this text belongs to. The given example is about a politician's manifesto that promises a transformative future but lacks specific policy measures. The context provided includes several argumentation schemes, so I need to match this to the right one.

First, I'll look at the key elements in the text. The politician's manifesto is vague because it doesn't outline specific policies. The context that requires specifics is a public debate, where detailed plans are expected. The argument here is that the vagueness in a context that requires precision should lead to rejection of the manifesto.

Looking at the schemes, the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme fits. The scheme involves a property (vague descriptors), which is vague for a certain standard (like clarity and precision), and occurs in a context requiring that standard. The conclusion is that the item should be rejected.

So, breaking down the text: the manifesto (Y) has the property of being vague (F = lack_of_specific_policy_measures), which is vague for the standard (PL = clarity_policy_details). It occurs in the context of a public debate (which requires clarity and specific measures). Therefore, the manifesto should be rejected.

I need to instantiate the variables correctly. The predicates would be has_property(manifesto, lack_of_specific_policy_measures), vague_for(lack_of_specific_policy_measures, clarity_policy_details), and occurs_in(manifesto, context_that_requires(clarity_policy_details)). The conclusion is should_be_rejected(manifesto).

I should check if this matches the structure of the Vagueness scheme. The example given in the context uses ambiguous descriptors and clarity_precision, so replacing those with the specific terms from the text should work. The answer should be in the exact format without any extra text.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to understand the text: "In a courtroom dispute, a clause in a legal contract used an ambiguous phrase without further definition." The conclusion here isn't explicitly stated, so I need to infer it based on the context examples.

Looking at the argumentation schemes provided, the relevant one here might be the "Vagueness of a Verbal Classification" scheme. The example given in the context involves a report with ambiguous descriptors in a context that requires clarity, leading to the conclusion that the report should be rejected. 

In the user's text, the ambiguous phrase in a legal contract (which is a context requiring precise definitions) would likely lead to the conclusion that the clause (or the contract) should be rejected. 

The scheme structure is: [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y). 

Variables to instantiate:
- Y: the legal contract clause
- F: ambiguous_phrase
- PL: precise_definitions (since legal contracts require precise terms)

So, the premises would be:
1. has_property(clause, ambiguous_phrase)
2. vague_for(ambiguous_phrase, precise_definitions)
3. occurs_in(clause, context_that_requires(precise_definitions))

Conclusion: should_be_rejected(clause)

I need to check if there's any other scheme that might fit. The text doesn't mention goals, classifications, or analogies, so the Vagueness of Verbal Classification seems correct. The example in the context matches the structure: ambiguous property in a context requiring clarity, leading to rejection. 

Therefore, the computational form should follow that structure exactly.


Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided an argument in natural language, and I need to translate it into a computational form using one of the given argumentation schemes. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the text given is: "At a technical review meeting, a software specification document repeatedly mentioned 'optimal performance' without detailing the metrics to achieve it." The task is to map this to one of the argumentation schemes provided in the context and fill in the variables correctly.

Looking at the context examples, there are several schemes like Analogy based on Classification, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Argument from Opposites, Moral Justification Ad Populum, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness of a Verbal Classification, etc. 

The example that comes to mind is the "Vagueness of a Verbal Classification Argumentation scheme." Let me check the structure of that scheme. The scheme is: [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y). 

The example given in the context was about a report with ambiguous descriptors in a context requiring clarity, leading to rejection. In the current text, the software document uses "optimal performance" without metrics, which is vague. The context is a technical review meeting, which likely requires precise specifications. 

Breaking down the elements: 

- Y (the subject) is the software specification document. 
- F (the property) is the vague term "optimal performance." 
- PL (the parameter) would be something like "specific metrics" or "clarity and precision" since the document lacks detailed metrics. 
- The context (context_that_requires(PL)) is the technical review meeting that requires specific metrics for performance. 

So, applying the scheme:
has_property(software_spec_doc, vague_term)
vague_for(vague_term, specific_metrics)
occurs_in(software_spec_doc, context_requiring_specific_metrics)
Therefore, should_be_rejected(software_spec_doc)

But need to match the exact predicates and variables. In the example, the vague property was 'ambiguous_descriptors' and the context required 'clarity_precision'. Here, the vague term is "optimal performance," which is vague because it lacks specific metrics. So maybe 'vague_term' is 'optimal_performance_without_metrics' or similar, but the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' for the property. Alternatively, maybe F is 'vague_optimal_performance' and PL is 'specific_metrics'. 

Wait, the example's predicates were: has_property(john_report, ambiguous_descriptors), vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision), occurs_in(john_report, context_that_requires(clarity_precision)). So in their case, F was the property (ambiguous descriptors), which is vague for PL (clarity_precision). 

In our case, the software document has the property of "optimal performance" without metrics. So maybe the property F is 'mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics', and PL is 'detailing_metrics' or 'specific_metrics'. The context is a technical review meeting, which requires that PL (specific metrics). 

So substituting:

has_property(software_spec_doc, mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics)
vague_for(mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics, specific_metrics)
occurs_in(software_spec_doc, context_that_requires(specific_metrics))

But how to phrase the properties? The original example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as F. Here, the vague property is the mention of "optimal performance" without details, which is a vague verbal classification. So perhaps F is 'vague_optimal_performance', and PL is 'specific_metrics' or 'clarity_precision' as in the example. 

Alternatively, maybe F is 'optimal_performance_mention', and PL is 'detailing_metrics'. 

The example's 'clarity_precision' was the PL, so maybe in this case, the context requires 'specific_metrics' or 'detailed_metrics'. 

I need to use the same structure. The example had 'ambiguous_descriptors' as F, which is vague for 'clarity_precision', and the context required 'clarity_precision'. 

In our case, the document has 'optimal performance' mentioned without metrics. So F is 'mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics', which is vague for 'specific_metrics'. The context is a technical review that requires specific metrics. 

So the predicates would be:

has_property(software_specification_document, mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics)

vague_for(mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics, specific_metrics)

occurs_in(software_specification_document, context_that_requires(specific_metrics))

Then, the conclusion is should_be_rejected(software_specification_document).

Now, check if this aligns with the scheme. The scheme is: [has_property(Y,F), vague_for(F,PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y).

Yes, that fits. The variables would be:

Y = software_specification_document

F = mentioning_optimal_performance_without_metrics

PL = specific_metrics

But the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' and 'clarity_precision'. Maybe the PL here is 'specific_metrics', which is the required parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe 'clarity_precision' is still applicable, as the example's PL was 'clarity_precision', which is a more general term. But since the user's text is about lacking metrics, perhaps 'specific_metrics' is more accurate. However, the exact terms need to be decided based on the example. The example used 'clarity_precision' as PL, so maybe here, the PL is 'clarity_precision' as well, since the lack of metrics makes it vague in terms of clarity. 

Wait, in the example, the vague_for(F, PL) was 'ambiguous_descriptors' being vague for 'clarity_precision'. So in this case, the vague term is "optimal performance" without metrics, which is vague for 'clarity_precision' or 'specific_metrics'. Which is better? 

Since the example uses 'clarity_precision' as PL, maybe we should follow that. So, even though the user's text is about missing metrics, the required parameter could still be 'clarity_precision' because that's what the example used, and the lack of metrics leads to a lack of clarity. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's PL is 'specific_metrics'. But the example's PL is 'clarity_precision'. To stay consistent with the example's structure, perhaps the PL should be 'clarity_precision' here as well. 

But in the user's case, the problem is the absence of specific metrics. So maybe 'specific_metrics' is the PL here. However, the scheme allows for any PL. The key is that the property F is vague for PL, and the context requires PL. 

So, in the example, the context required 'clarity_precision', so the PL was that. In our case, the context (technical review meeting) requires 'specific_metrics' because without them, you can't assess optimal performance. Therefore, 'specific_metrics' is the PL here. 

But the example used 'clarity_precision' as PL. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the PL is 'detailed_specifications' or something similar. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that "optimal performance" is a vague term, which is vague for 'specific_metrics', and the context requires 'specific_metrics'. 

So, the predicates would be:

has_property(software_spec_doc, vague_optimal_performance)

vague_for(vague_optimal_performance, specific_metrics)

occurs_in(software_spec_doc, context_that_requires(specific_metrics))

Then the conclusion is should_be_rejected(software_spec_doc)

But the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as F, which is a noun phrase. So here, maybe F is 'vague_optimal_performance_mention' or 'optimal_performance_without_metrics'. 

Alternatively, following the example, perhaps F is 'ambiguous_descriptors', but in the user's text, the descriptor is "optimal performance". But the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as a general property. Maybe in this case, the property is 'vague_performance_claims'. 

But the key is that the scheme's predicates need to be filled with the correct terms. Let's try to structure it exactly as per the example. 

In the example, the report had 'ambiguous_descriptors' (F), which is vague for 'clarity_precision' (PL), and the context required 'clarity_precision'. 

In the user's text, the software document has 'optimal performance' mentioned without metrics, which is a vague descriptor. So perhaps F is 'vague_performance_descriptors', PL is 'specific_metrics', and the context is a technical review meeting that requires specific_metrics. 

But the example's PL was 'clarity_precision', which is a more general term. Maybe in this case, the PL is 'specific_metrics', and the context_that_requires is 'specific_metrics'. 

Alternatively, maybe the PL is 'clarity_precision', and the lack of metrics makes the document lack clarity. 

The example's conclusion was that the report should be rejected because it was vague in a context that requires clarity. Similarly, here, the software document is vague (lacks metrics) in a context (technical review) that requires clarity (specific metrics). So maybe the PL is 'clarity_precision' as in the example. 

But then, how does 'optimal performance' being vague relate to clarity and precision? It does, because without metrics, it's not precise. So maybe:

has_property(software_spec_doc, ambiguous_descriptors)

vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision)

occurs_in(software_spec_doc, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))

Therefore, should_be_rejected(software_spec_doc)

But in the user's text, the ambiguous descriptor is specifically "optimal performance" without metrics. However, the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as a general term. So perhaps in this case, the F is 'ambiguous_descriptors', which is vague for 'clarity_precision', and the context is the technical review meeting that requires clarity and precision. 

This would align with the example's structure. Even though the specific vague term is "optimal performance", the general property is ambiguous descriptors. But the example's 'ambiguous_descriptors' might be a placeholder for any kind of vague terms. 

Alternatively, if the user's text specifically mentions "optimal performance" without metrics, maybe F should be 'optimal_performance_without_metrics', but that might not fit the example's structure. 

Wait, the example's first predicate was 'has_property(john_report, ambiguous_descriptors)'. So the subject (john_report) has the property of having ambiguous descriptors. In the user's case, the software_spec_doc has the property of mentioning "optimal performance" without metrics. So the property is not just ambiguous descriptors but a specific type of ambiguous descriptor. But the example used a more general term. 

But the problem is that the user's text is an instance of the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme. So to fit the scheme, we need to represent the specific elements. 

Alternatively, maybe F is 'vague_verbal_classification', but the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors'. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use 'optimal_performance_mention_without_metrics' as the F, but the example used 'ambiguous_descriptors', which is more general. 

I think the safest way is to follow the example's structure. The example used 'ambiguous_descriptors' as F, which is vague for 'clarity_precision', and the context requires 'clarity_precision'. So in the user's case, even though the specific descriptor is different, the structure would be the same. 

Therefore:

has_property(software_specification_document, ambiguous_descriptors)

vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision)

occurs_in(software_specification_document, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))

Then the conclusion is should_be_rejected(software_specification_document)

But in the user's text, the ambiguous descriptor is "optimal performance" without metrics, so maybe 'ambiguous_descriptors' is too generic. However, the example's 'ambiguous_descriptors' could be considered a general category that includes terms like "optimal performance" without specifics. 

Alternatively, maybe we can define F as 'optimal_performance_without_metrics', but then the scheme requires that vague_for(F, PL). So if F is 'optimal_performance_without_metrics', then PL would be 'specific_metrics'. But the example used 'clarity_precision' as PL. 

Hmm. The example's PL was 'clarity_precision', which is the parameter that the vague property is vague for. In the user's case, the vague property is not providing specific metrics, so PL could be 'specific_metrics', but the example's PL was 'clarity_precision'. However, 'specific_metrics' might be a part of clarity and precision. 

This is a bit tricky. To stay as close as possible to the example, maybe the PL should be 'clarity_precision' here as well. 

So, the computational form would be:

[has_property(software_specification_document, ambiguous_descriptors), vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision), occurs_in(software_specification_document, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))], should_be_rejected(software_specification_document)

But wait, the example's 'ambiguous_descriptors' are vague for 'clarity_precision', which is required in the context. In the user's case, the context is a technical review meeting where clarity and precision (in the form of specific metrics) are required. 

So this seems to fit. The software document has ambiguous descriptors (like "optimal performance"), which are vague in terms of clarity and precision, and the context requires clarity and precision. Therefore, the document should be rejected. 

Yes, that aligns with the example. Therefore, the answer should be structured as such.


Okay, let's try to figure out which argumentation scheme this text belongs to. The example given is about a critic's review in an art gallery evaluation. The review describes a modern sculpture as "deeply profound" but doesn't support that claim with analytical insight. The user wants me to translate this into the computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context provided.

First, I need to recall the different schemes listed. Let's go through them one by one.

The example mentions the sculpture's description as "deeply profound" without support. This seems to relate to vagueness or ambiguity in the classification. Looking at the schemes, there's one called "Vagueness of a Verbal Classification Argumentation scheme." The structure here is [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y). 

In the example provided in the context (John's report with ambiguous descriptors), the key elements are the property (ambiguous descriptors), that property being vague for clarity and precision, and occurring in a context that requires clarity and precision. The conclusion is that the report should be rejected.

Now, applying this to the art gallery scenario. The critic's review uses "deeply profound" which is a vague term (F). The property here is the vague descriptor. The context is an art gallery evaluation (PL would be something like analytical insight or specificity required). The argument is that because the review is vague in a context that requires precise analysis, it should be rejected.

So mapping the elements: Y is the critic's review, F is "deeply profound" (or similar), PL is the required analytical insight. The context requires PL (analytical insight), and since F is vague for PL, the review should be rejected.

Checking the variables: has_property(review, vague_descriptor), vague_for(vague_descriptor, required_analytical_insight), occurs_in(review, context_that_requires(required_analytical_insight)). Conclusion: should_be_rejected(review).

So the predicates would be:

has_property(critics_review, deeply_profound), vague_for(deeply_profound, analytical_insight), occurs_in(critics_review, context_that_requires(analytical_insight))], should_be_rejected(critics_review).

Wait, maybe "deeply profound" is the vague property. But in the example, the property was "ambiguous_descriptors". So perhaps here, the property is "vague_descriptors" or "unsupported_claim". Alternatively, the exact phrase "deeply profound" is the F. But the scheme uses F as a property. So the has_property(Y, F) would have F as the vague term. Then vague_for(F, PL) where PL is the required precision. So in the example, ambiguous_descriptors are vague_for clarity_precision. Here, "deeply profound" is the F, which is vague_for analytical_insight. The context requires analytical_insight (PL), so occurs_in the review in that context. Thus, the conclusion is should_be_rejected.

So the final answer should have:

has_property(critics_review, deeply_profound), vague_for(deeply_profound, analytical_insight), occurs_in(critics_review, context_that_requires(analytical_insight))], should_be_rejected(critics_review)

But I need to make sure the variables are correctly instantiated. The example used john_report, ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision. Similarly here, the review (critics_review) has the property "deeply_profound", which is vague_for "analytical_insight", and occurs in a context requiring analytical_insight. So that fits the scheme.


Okay, let's try to figure out the computational form for this argument. The text is about a marketing slogan claiming a product is "the best ever" without providing data. The user mentioned it's an enthymeme, so maybe there's a missing premise or conclusion.

First, I need to match it to one of the given argumentation schemes. Let me look through the examples again. The schemes include things like analogy, cause-effect, moral justification, classification, etc.

The example given in the context for Vagueness of a Verbal Classification is when a report uses ambiguous terms in a context that requires clarity. The structure here is similar. The slogan uses "the best ever," which is vague, and in a context where substantiation (like data) is needed. 

So, the predicates for that scheme are: has_property(Y,F), vague_for(F,PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL)), leading to should_be_rejected(Y). 

Applying this to the text: The slogan (Y) has the property of being "the best ever" (F). "Best ever" is vague (vague_for F, PL). The context is a brand presentation (PL might be something like substantiated_claims). Therefore, the slogan should be rejected.

Variables:
Y = marketing_slogan (or product? Wait, the slogan is the subject here. The slogan is claimed to be "the best ever". So Y is the slogan.

F would be "best_ever_claim" or similar. PL (the parameter of vagueness) would be something like "substantiated_claims" because the context requires data to back up claims. 

So, has_property(marketing_slogan, best_ever_claim). Then, vague_for(best_ever_claim, substantiated_claims). The slogan occurs in a brand presentation context, which requires substantiated claims. Therefore, should_be_rejected(marketing_slogan).

Putting it all together, the computational form would be:

[has_property(marketing_slogan, best_ever_claim), vague_for(best_ever_claim, substantiated_claims), occurs_in(marketing_slogan, context_that_requires(substantiated_claims))], should_be_rejected(marketing_slogan)

I need to make sure the predicates are correctly instantiated. The product's slogan is the Y here. The property is the vague claim. The context that requires substantiated claims is the brand presentation. Yes, that fits the example given in the context. So this matches the Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme.
