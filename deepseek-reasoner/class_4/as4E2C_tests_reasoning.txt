Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, the text given is: "In this case, the person exercises regularly." That's all. But the user mentioned it's an enthymeme, which means either the conclusion or a premise is missing. My job is to figure out which argumentation scheme this belongs to and fill in the missing parts based on the examples provided.

Looking at the context examples, there are several schemes. Let's go through each to see which fits.

The first example is Analogy based on Classification. It uses features and classification. The text here doesn't mention features of two things being compared, so probably not that.

Effect to Cause: The example uses an event leading to another. The given text just states a fact ("exercises regularly") but doesn't mention a following effect. Unless there's a missing conclusion like "therefore they are healthy," but the text as is doesn't show that.

Need for Help: This involves helping someone, can carry out, and cost. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Argument from Opposites: Talks about opposite properties. Not applicable here.

Moral Justification Ad Populum: Involves what everyone accepts and goals. The text doesn't mention others' acceptance or goals.

Classification: This scheme is about classes. Like all eagles are birds, so white eagles are birds. The example uses classification(F,G) and be(A,F) to conclude be(A,G). The given text says "the person exercises regularly." Maybe if there's a missing premise that people who exercise regularly are healthy, then the conclusion would be the person is healthy. But the text as given is incomplete.

Necessary Condition: Relates goals and necessary conditions. The text doesn't mention a goal or a necessary condition, so probably not.

Position to Know: Involves someone in a position asserting something. The text just states a fact about a person exercising, not someone's assertion based on their position.

Double Standard: Different treatments of similar situations. Not applicable here.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: Involves vague properties in a context requiring precision. The text here is straightforward, not vague.

Wait, the text provided is very short. Let me recheck. The user says it's an enthymeme, so maybe the conclusion is missing. For example, if the argument is "In this case, the person exercises regularly. Therefore, they are healthy." But which scheme would that fit?

Looking at the examples again, the Effect to Cause scheme is [occured(A), followed(A,B)], occurs(B). So if exercising is A, and the effect is B (like being healthy), then the argument would be that since A occurred, and A is followed by B, then B occurs. But in the user's text, the premises might be missing the followed(A,B) part. The original example for Effect to Cause had a premise that providing service leads to satisfaction, then the company provided service, so satisfaction increases. The structure is: premise1 (if A then B), premise2 (A happened), conclusion (B happens). But the user's text only has "A happened" (exercises regularly). So maybe the missing premise is the general rule that exercising leads to health, and the conclusion is being healthy. But the user's text doesn't include the general rule. However, in the example provided in the context, the Effect to Cause example includes both premises: "if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase" (the followed part) and "the company provides excellent customer service" (the occurred part), leading to the conclusion.

But the user's text only states "the person exercises regularly." So maybe the user's enthymeme is missing the general rule (followed(A,B)) and the conclusion (occurs(B)). Therefore, the full argument would be:

Premise1: Exercising regularly (A) is followed by being healthy (B).

Premise2: The person exercises regularly (A occurred).

Conclusion: Therefore, the person is healthy (B occurs).

But the text provided is only the second premise. However, in the user's text, the argument given is just "In this case, the person exercises regularly." That's only premise2. The conclusion is missing, and premise1 is missing. But enthymemes often leave out a premise or the conclusion. So perhaps the user's argument is missing the conclusion. But how do I know which scheme? The Effect to Cause requires both the occurrence and the followed by part. But the user's text only has the occurrence. So maybe it's not that.

Wait, looking at the Necessary Condition scheme. If the person's goal is to be healthy, and exercising is a necessary condition, then the conclusion is that exercising is necessary. But the text doesn't mention a goal.

Alternatively, maybe the Classification scheme. If all people who exercise are healthy, and this person exercises, then they are healthy. The Classification scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). So classification(exercise, healthy), be(person, exercise), therefore be(person, healthy). But the text only has "the person exercises regularly" which is be(person, exercise). The missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion. However, the original example of Classification is about eagles being birds. So the structure is a general classification.

But the user's text is missing the general premise (all exercisers are healthy) and the conclusion. However, the user might be expecting that the given text is one premise, and the other premise and conclusion are missing, but the scheme is something else.

Wait, let's check the examples again. The user provided the text: "In this case, the person exercises regularly." Let's see the context examples. For instance, the Effect to Cause example's computational form is [occured(provides(...)), followed(...)], conclusion. The example includes both the occurrence and the followed by relation.

But the user's text only has the occurrence (the person exercises). If the conclusion is missing, like "therefore [some effect occurs]", but without the followed by premise, how can we fit this into a scheme? Maybe the user's argument is incomplete, but the task is to identify the scheme based on the given part and infer the missing parts.

Alternatively, maybe the text is part of a different scheme. Let's look again. For example, the Position to Know scheme requires someone in a position asserting something. The text doesn't mention that.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the answer is using the Effect to Cause scheme, but with the assumption that the followed by premise is implicit. For example, the user's text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly." The conclusion would be the effect, but the effect isn't stated, so perhaps the example is expecting that the argument is structured as [occured(exercise), followed(exercise, health)], therefore health occurs. But the given text only has occured(exercise). However, the problem states that the enthymeme might have missing premises or conclusion, so perhaps the user's argument is missing the followed by premise and the conclusion.

But how to determine which scheme? The user must choose from the given examples. Let's check each scheme again.

The Effect to Cause scheme is [occured(A), followed(A,B)], occurs(B). So in the example, the premises are the occurrence of A and that A is followed by B. The conclusion is B occurs.

In the user's text, only A is occurred (exercises). The other premise (followed(A,B)) and the conclusion (B) are missing. So the full argument would need those. But the user's text only provides one premise. So the answer would need to infer the missing parts. But the problem says to instantiate all variables and predicates given the enthymeme. So perhaps the user's text is only providing the occurred(A) part, and the rest needs to be inferred, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is using the Necessary Condition scheme. If the person's goal is to be healthy, and exercising is a necessary condition, then the conclusion is that exercising is necessary. But the user's text doesn't mention a goal.

Wait, the user's text is very minimal. Let's look at the computational form. For example, in the Effect to Cause example, the computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(provides(...), increases(...))], conclusion.

In the user's case, the occurred part is "the person exercises regularly." So occured(exercise(person)). Then the followed by part would be followed(exercise(person), B), where B is some effect. But since the text doesn't mention B, maybe B is left as a variable? But the problem says to instantiate all variables. Wait, the instruction says to "infer the missing components." So perhaps the user's text is only the premise that A occurred (exercise), and the missing premise is followed(A,B), and the conclusion is B occurs.

But without knowing what B is, how can we instantiate it? Maybe the user's example expects that B is inferred from common sense, like health. But the problem states that variables must be instantiated. The example uses specific terms. So in the computational form, we need to have concrete terms, not variables.

Therefore, perhaps the user's argument is missing both the followed by premise and the conclusion, but the scheme is Effect to Cause. So the answer would be:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(exercise(person), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

But how to represent this in the computational form. The example uses predicates like occured(provides(...)) and followed(occured(...), ...). Wait, in the example, the first premise is occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), and the second is followed(occured(...), ...). Wait, looking at the example:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the example again:

The example's computational form is written as [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

Wait, the structure is [occured(A), followed(A, B)], B.

So for the user's text, the premises would be:

occured(exercise(person)) and followed(exercise(person), B), leading to conclusion B.

But the user's text only gives occured(exercise(person)). So the missing parts are followed(exercise(person), B) and the conclusion B. But how to infer B? The text doesn't mention it. Maybe the user intended this as part of the Effect to Cause scheme, but with missing premises. However, the problem says to "infer the missing components" based on the enthymeme. Since the text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly," which is similar to the example's "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service," which is premise2 (A occurred), then the other premise is the general rule (A is followed by B). But without knowing B, how can we instantiate?

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is incomplete, and the answer is that it belongs to the Effect to Cause scheme, with the given premise being occured(A), and the missing premise followed(A,B) and conclusion B. But variables need to be instantiated, but since the text doesn't provide B, maybe the answer uses variables, but the problem says variables must be instantiated. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem states: "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

So, I need to figure out the exact predicates. For the Effect to Cause scheme, the premises are occured(A) and followed(A, B), and the conclusion is B. The user's text provides A as "the person exercises regularly." So A is exercise(person). But what is B? Since the conclusion is missing, we need to infer B. But the text doesn't state it. How?

Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is that the argument is missing the conclusion, which would be B, and the general rule (followed(A,B)). But without knowing B, how to instantiate? Maybe the answer leaves B as a placeholder, but the problem says variables must be instantiated.

Wait, looking at the example in the context for Effect to Cause:

Premise1: Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase.

Premise2: In this case, the company provides excellent customer service.

Conclusion: Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase.

The computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So in the user's case, if we follow this structure:

Premise1: If a person exercises regularly, then [effect].

Premise2: The person exercises regularly.

Conclusion: Therefore, [effect].

But the user's text only has premise2. The missing parts are premise1 and the conclusion. However, the problem states that the enthymeme might have a missing premise or conclusion. So in the user's case, perhaps the argument is presented as premise2 and conclusion, missing premise1. Or maybe premise1 and premise2, missing conclusion. But the text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly." That's only premise2. So the missing parts are premise1 (the general rule) and the conclusion.

But how to represent this? The user's instruction says to infer the missing components. Since the example in the context includes both premises and the conclusion, but the user's text only includes the second premise (A occurred), the missing components are the first premise (A is followed by B) and the conclusion (B).

But since the user's text doesn't mention B, how can we infer it? The problem might expect that B is left as a variable, but the instructions say to instantiate all variables. Therefore, perhaps there's a standard way to represent this.

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is not part of the Effect to Cause scheme. Let's check other schemes again.

Wait, the Classification scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, All eagles are birds (classification(eagle, bird)), White eagles are eagles (be(white_eagle, eagle)), therefore White eagles are birds (be(white_eagle, bird)).

If the user's text is "the person exercises regularly," maybe it's part of a classification. For example, if there's a classification that people who exercise are healthy, and this person is classified as exercising, so they are healthy. But the text only states the classification premise (be(person, exercises_regularly)), and the missing parts are the classification rule and the conclusion.

But the user's text doesn't mention the classification rule. However, the example for Classification includes both premises. So unless the user's text is missing one premise and the conclusion, but the scheme would be Classification.

But I'm not sure. The text is very minimal. Let's think: the user's text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly." If this is part of a Classification argument, then the other premise would be "All people who exercise regularly are healthy" (classification(exercise_regularly, healthy)), and the conclusion is "the person is healthy." But the user's text only gives the premise that the person exercises (be(person, exercise_regularly)).

But the example's computational form for Classification is [classification(eagle, bird), be(white_eagle, eagle)], be(white_eagle, bird). So the user's argument would need classification(exercise_regularly, healthy) and be(person, exercise_regularly) to conclude be(person, healthy). But since the user's text only gives be(person, exercise_regularly), the other premise and conclusion are missing.

But the problem states that the argument is an enthymeme, which could have a missing premise or conclusion. So if the user's text is presenting one premise and the conclusion is missing, then the scheme is Classification. But how to determine which?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Effect to Cause, but the problem is that the user's text is only one premise. However, in the example of Effect to Cause, both premises are present. So unless the user's text is missing the general rule, the conclusion would be the effect.

But without knowing the effect, how to proceed? Maybe the answer assumes that the effect is implied, like "therefore they are healthy," but how to represent that in the computational form.

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is part of the Necessary Condition scheme. For example, if the person's goal is to be healthy, and exercising is a necessary condition. But the text doesn't mention a goal.

Given the ambiguity, I need to look for the most plausible scheme. The user's text is a single premise stating that an action occurred. The example for Effect to Cause also has a single premise in the text (the action occurred), but in reality, the example includes both premises. Wait, no: the example's natural language includes both the general rule and the specific case, leading to the conclusion. The user's text is only the specific case. So the enthymeme is missing the general rule and the conclusion. Therefore, the scheme is Effect to Cause.

So the computational form would be [occured(exercise(person)), followed(occured(exercise(person)), effect)], effect. But the effect needs to be instantiated. Since the text doesn't specify, perhaps the effect is a variable, but the problem says to instantiate all variables. This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the argument is missing the conclusion, and the premises are the occurred and followed by. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the correct scheme is Position to Know. For example, if the person is a doctor who exercises, but the text doesn't mention that.

No, the text doesn't mention any position.

Another approach: Check the schemes again and see which one's premises can be matched with the given text.

The given text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly."

Looking at the schemes:

- Analogy based on Classification: Requires two items with features and classification. Not matching.
- Effect to Cause: Requires occurrence of A and A followed by B. Text has A occurred. Missing A followed by B and conclusion B.
- Need for Help: Not applicable.
- Argument from Opposites: No opposites mentioned.
- Moral Justification Ad Populum: No mention of others' acceptance or goals.
- Classification: Requires classification rule and being part of a class. Text has being part of a class, missing the classification rule.
- Necessary Condition: Requires goal and necessary condition. Not here.
- Position to Know: No position mentioned.
- Double Standard: Different treatments. Not here.
- Vagueness: No mention of vagueness.

So the possible schemes are Effect to Cause or Classification. The text has one premise, but which scheme's premises can it fit into?

In the Classification scheme, the premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The given text has be(A,F) (the person exercises). So if the enthymeme is missing classification(F,G) (e.g., people who exercise are healthy), then the conclusion would be be(A,G) (person is healthy). But the user's text doesn't mention the classification rule.

In Effect to Cause, the premises are occured(A) and followed(A,B). The text has occured(A), missing followed(A,B) and conclusion B.

Which scheme is more likely? The example of Effect to Cause in the context has the same structure: "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." The computational form includes both the occurrence and the followed by.

But the user's text only has the occurrence part. So if the enthymeme is missing the general rule (followed by) and the conclusion, then the scheme is Effect to Cause.

But how to instantiate the variables without knowing B? Maybe in the example, the conclusion is the effect, which is not mentioned in the text. Therefore, perhaps the answer can't be determined. But the problem states to infer the missing components.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(exercise(person), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

But how to know that B is healthy? The text doesn't say. But maybe it's inferred from common sense. However, the problem requires exact instantiation based on the text, not external knowledge.

Therefore, this might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the answer uses a placeholder, but the problem says variables must be instantiated. This is conflicting.

Wait, looking back at the user's example in the context for Effect to Cause:

The natural language example includes both the general rule and the specific case. The computational form includes both premises. So if the user's text is only the specific case ("In this case, the person exercises regularly"), then the enthymeme is missing the general rule and the conclusion. Therefore, the full argument would require:

Premise1: Generally, if a person exercises regularly, then [effect occurs].

Premise2: In this case, the person exercises regularly.

Conclusion: Therefore, [effect occurs].

But without knowing the effect, how can we instantiate the variables? The problem might expect that the effect is left as a variable, but the instruction says to instantiate all variables. Therefore, this approach isn't feasible.

Wait, maybe the answer is that the scheme is Effect to Cause, and the missing components are filled with placeholders. But the example in the context uses specific terms. For example, the followed by part is specific: provides(company,excellent_customer_service) is followed by increases(company,customer_satisfaction).

In the user's case, the action is exercise(person), and the effect would need to be something like healthy(person). But since it's not in the text, perhaps the answer assumes that the effect is implicit, and thus the computational form is:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(exercise(person), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

But the problem states that the answer must be exactly in the format, so perhaps this is the intended answer, assuming that the effect is healthy(person) even though it's not mentioned. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the answer may use a more general term. However, without explicit information, it's hard to know. But given the instructions, I must proceed.

Another possibility: The user's text is part of the Necessary Condition scheme. For example, if the person's goal is to be healthy, and exercising is a necessary condition. The premises would be goal(healthy(person)) and necessary_condition(healthy(person), exercise(person)), leading to is_necessary(exercise(person)). But the text doesn't mention a goal.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Classification scheme. For example, if the premise is be(person, exercise_regularly) and the classification is classification(exercise_regularly, healthy), leading to be(person, healthy). But again, the text doesn't mention the classification.

Given that the user's text is very minimal and only provides one premise, but the example in the context for Effect to Cause includes both premises and the conclusion, I think the intended answer is the Effect to Cause scheme. The user's text provides the occurred(A) premise, and the missing parts are followed(A,B) and the conclusion B. But to instantiate B, we have to assume it's something, like healthy(person).

But is there any clue in the user's text? The text is "In this case, the person exercises regularly." The example in the context for Effect to Cause starts with "In this case," which matches the user's text. The example then states the occurrence of the cause and the conclusion is the effect. So perhaps the user's text is similar, and the answer should mirror the example.

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(exercise(person), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

But the problem is, in the example, the followed by is between the occurrence and the effect. Wait, in the example's computational form, the followed is between the occurred event and the effect. The example's followed is: followed(occured(provides(company,...)), increases(...)).

Wait, the example's followed predicate is followed(occured(A), B), where A is provides(company, excellent_customer_service), and B is increases(company, customer_satisfaction).

So for the user's case, A is exercise(person). Therefore, followed(occured(exercise(person)), B). But B would need to be an effect, like healthy(person).

But in the example, the first argument of followed is occured(A), not A itself. So the followed predicate in the example is followed(occured(A), B), not followed(A, B). This is important.

So for the user's case, the followed predicate should be followed(occured(exercise(person)), healthy(person)).

Therefore, the full computational form would be:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(occured(exercise(person)), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

But how do we know that the effect is healthy? It's not stated, but perhaps it's inferred. However, the problem requires instantiating all variables, so maybe the answer leaves the effect as a variable, but that's not allowed. Alternatively, perhaps the effect is omitted, but the example shows that the effect is explicitly stated.

Given that the user's text is so minimal and the example starts with "In this case," which is the same as the user's text, I think the intended answer is the Effect to Cause scheme, with the given premise being occured(exercise(person)), and the missing parts being followed(occured(exercise(person)), B) and B. But since B isn't specified, maybe the answer uses a placeholder. However, the example uses specific terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(occured(exercise(person)), occurs(effect))], occurs(effect)

But the example uses specific effects, not a placeholder. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects that the effect is unspecified, but given the problem's instructions, it's necessary to instantiate all variables. Therefore, perhaps the user's text is not complete enough, but the assistant must proceed with the information given.

But since the user's text only provides the occurred(A) part, and the scheme is Effect to Cause, the answer must be structured accordingly. In the example, the first premise is occured(A), and the second is followed(occured(A), B). Therefore, the user's text's computational form would be:

[occured(exercise(person)), followed(occured(exercise(person)), healthy(person))], healthy(person)

Assuming that the effect is healthy(person), even though it's not stated. But this is an assumption based on common knowledge, which might not be intended. However, the problem requires instantiating all variables, so this might be the expected answer.

Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and the correct scheme is different. But given the available information, I think the best fit is Effect to Cause, with the missing parts inferred.


Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user gave me an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the provided context. The text is: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve."

First, I need to recall the different argumentation schemes in the context. Let's look through them:

1. **Analogy based on Classification**: Involves features and classification. The example talks about smartphones with certain features being classified as flagship. But the given text doesn't mention classification based on features. So maybe not this one.

2. **Effect to Cause**: The structure here is [occurred(A), followed(occurred(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example uses a company providing good service leading to increased satisfaction. The user's text is a general statement: investing in training leads to improved performance. This seems similar. The structure would be if A occurs (investing), then B (improvement) follows. So the argument is stating a cause (investment) leading to an effect (improvement). But wait, the example's structure is [occured(provides(...)), followed(...)], and the conclusion is the effect. The user's text is a general statement, but maybe it's the premise. If the argument given is the first part of the effect to cause scheme, then the conclusion would be that if a company does invest, then performance improves. Wait, the example has a structure where the premise is that the cause occurred (providing service) and the effect follows, leading to the conclusion that the effect occurs. The user's text is more like a general rule. Wait, the user's text is "Generally, if a company invests... then performance improves." That seems like the general premise. But in the effect to cause example, the general premise is part of the scheme. Wait, looking back at the effect to cause scheme as defined: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example's premises are "the company provides excellent service" (occurred(A)), and "if A occurs, then B follows" (followed(...)), leading to the conclusion that B occurs. But in the user's text, the statement is "Generally, if A occurs, then B occurs." That might be part of the scheme. Wait, the user's text is presented as the enthymeme. So perhaps the full argument is missing a premise. For example, if the argument is: "Generally, if a company invests in training, performance improves. Company X has invested in training. Therefore, their performance will improve." Then the scheme would apply. But in the given text, only the general statement is provided. However, the user says that the text is an enthymeme where a premise or conclusion is missing. So maybe the user's text is the general premise, and the conclusion would be the specific application. But in the example, the Effect to Cause scheme has two premises: occurred(A) and followed(occurred(A), occurs(B)), leading to occurs(B). So if the enthymeme provided is only the general premise (the followed part), then the missing parts would be the occurred(A) and the conclusion occurs(B). But the user's text is "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." That sounds like the general rule (the followed part). If the argument is being used to conclude that a specific company's performance will improve because they invested in training, then the premises would be: occurred(invest_company_training) and followed(invest, improve). Then the conclusion is occurs(improve). But in the user's text, only the general rule is given. Wait, the user's instruction says that the text is an enthymeme, which might be missing a premise or conclusion. So maybe the actual argument is: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve. The company has invested in training. Therefore, their performance will improve." But the user only provided the general statement. However, the task is to translate the given argument into computational form, inferring the missing components. The example in the context for Effect to Cause has the premises as [occured(provides(company,...)), followed(...)], and the conclusion as increases(...). So perhaps in the user's case, the full argument would need to have occurred(A) and followed(A,B), leading to occurs(B). But the text provided is just the followed part. Wait, maybe the text is presented as the enthymeme where the conclusion is missing. For example, the user's text is the first premise (the general rule), and the missing premise is that the company did invest, leading to the conclusion that performance improves. But the user only provided the general statement. Hmm. But the example shows that the premises include both the general rule and the specific occurrence. So in the example, the premises are: "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." So the computational form is [occured(provides(company, excellent...)), followed(..., ...)], and the conclusion. So in that case, the user's text is the general part (the followed relation), but the enthymeme is missing the occurred(A) and the conclusion. Wait, the user's text is "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." So that's the followed part. If the argument is presented as an enthymeme, perhaps the conclusion is missing, and the other premise (that the company did invest) is missing. However, the task is to infer the missing parts based on the given text. But the user's text is only the general statement. Wait, perhaps the argument is structured as follows: the general rule (if A then B) is the premise, and the conclusion is that if a company wants B, they should do A. But no, that's not matching the effect to cause scheme. Wait, let's re-examine the Effect to Cause scheme as defined: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So the two premises are that A occurred, and that A is followed by B. The conclusion is that B occurs. So in the example, the two premises are "the company provides excellent customer service" (occurred(A)), and "if a company provides excellent service, then satisfaction increases" (followed(A,B)). Therefore, the conclusion is that satisfaction increases. So in the user's text, if the given enthymeme is the general statement (followed(A,B)), then the missing premises would be occurred(A) and the conclusion occurs(B). But if the user's text is the entire argument, then perhaps it's incomplete. Wait, but the user's text is presented as the enthymeme. So perhaps the user's text is only the general premise (the followed part), and the conclusion and other premise are missing. But in the example, the premises are both the general rule and the specific occurrence. So the user's text is part of the premises. Therefore, to form the full computational argument, we need to have both premises and the conclusion. But the user's text only gives the followed part. However, since the task is to infer the missing components, perhaps the argument is structured such that the given text is the followed premise, and the other premise (occurred(A)) is missing, as well as the conclusion. But in the example, the computational form for Effect to Cause is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So in the user's case, A is "company invests in employee training" and B is "employee performance will improve". So the premises would be:

1. occurred(invest(company, employee_training)) 
2. followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), occurs(improve(employee_performance)))

Conclusion: occurs(improve(employee_performance))

But in the user's text, the given statement is the general rule, which corresponds to the second premise (followed). The missing premise is the occurrence of the cause (A), and the conclusion is the effect (B). But if the user's text is the entire argument, perhaps it's missing parts. However, the user's text is: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." So that's the followed part. The full argument would need another premise stating that a company has invested in training, leading to the conclusion that their performance improves. So the enthymeme is missing the specific case. But how to represent this? Let's look at the example again. In the example, the computational form is: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

But the user's text only has the "followed" part. So perhaps in the enthymeme, the other premise (occurred(A)) and the conclusion are missing, but the user's text is only providing the general rule. However, since the task is to translate the given argument into computational form, and the user's text is the enthymeme (missing parts), we need to infer what's missing. But in the example, the Effect to Cause scheme requires both premises: occurred(A) and followed(A,B). The user's text provides the followed(A,B) part. So if the argument is using the Effect to Cause scheme, the premises would be the general rule (followed) and the occurrence of the cause (occurred(A)), leading to the effect (B). But the user's text only gives the general rule. So the enthymeme is missing the specific occurrence and the conclusion. But the task says "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So we need to assume that the user's text is the general premise (followed), and perhaps the other premise and conclusion are inferred. But how? Maybe the example's structure is:

Premise 1: occurred(A) (specific case)
Premise 2: followed(A, B) (general rule)
Conclusion: occurs(B)

So in the user's case, if the enthymeme is the general rule (Premise 2), then perhaps the specific case (Premise 1) is missing, and the conclusion is also missing. But we need to instantiate all variables. Wait, but the user's instruction says to translate the given argument, which is an enthymeme. So maybe the user's text is the entire argument as presented, but it's missing parts. For example, in the example, the argument is: "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." So the premises are both the general rule and the specific case. The user's text is only the general rule. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the specific case and the conclusion. But how to represent that? Wait, no. The task says to "infer the missing components" from the given enthymeme. So if the user's text is only the general statement, which is part of the premises, then the other premise and conclusion must be inferred. However, without additional information, how can we infer the specific company? Maybe the variables can be left as placeholders? But the example uses specific instances. Alternatively, perhaps the user's text is presented as the entire argument, but in enthymeme form, missing a premise or conclusion. For example, if the argument is presented as: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve. Therefore, employee performance will improve." Then the missing premise is that the company did invest. But in the user's text, only the general statement is given, so perhaps it's missing both the specific case and the conclusion. Alternatively, maybe the user's text is the entire argument, but it's missing parts. However, the user's text seems to be a single premise. So perhaps the argument is: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve. [Missing: Company X has invested in employee training.] Therefore, Company X's employee performance will improve." But since the variables are not specified, maybe we need to use variables like A and B. Wait, but the example uses specific terms. Let me check the example again. The Effect to Cause example's computational form is:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the first premise is occurred(A), where A is provides(company, excellent_customer_service). The second premise is followed(occurred(A), B), where B is increases(company,customer_satisfaction). The conclusion is B.

In the user's case, the general statement is "if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." This corresponds to followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), occurs(improve(employee_performance))). 

But to form the full argument, there should be another premise: occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), leading to the conclusion occurs(improve(employee_performance)).

But the user's text is only the general rule (the followed premise). Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the occurred(A) premise and the conclusion. However, the task requires us to infer the missing components. But how? Without knowing which company, we can't instantiate specific terms. Wait, perhaps the variables can be generalized. Let's think: in the example, the company is a specific instance (maybe a particular company, but in the example, it's just referred to as "the company"). So perhaps the user's text can be represented with variables. Alternatively, maybe the user's text is only the followed part, and we need to represent it as such in the computational form, even if the other premise is missing. But the instructions say to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So even if the enthymeme is missing parts, we need to fill them in based on inference. But how? Perhaps the user's text is part of a larger argument where the other premise and conclusion are implied. For example, if someone says "Generally, if A then B. Therefore, B." Then the missing premise is A. But in the user's text, we only have the general statement. To make this a complete argument, we need the other premise (A occurred) and the conclusion (B). But since the user's text doesn't specify a particular company, maybe we can assume a general company or use variables. However, in the example, the company is referred to as "company" without a specific name. Let's see the example's representation: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(...)], so the company is represented as 'company' as a constant. So perhaps in the user's case, we can represent the company as a general 'company' entity. So the premises would be:

1. occurred(invest(company, employee_training))
2. followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), improve(employee_performance))

Conclusion: improve(employee_performance)

But in the user's text, only the second premise is given. But the task is to infer the missing components. Wait, but the user's text is the enthymeme, which might be the entire argument as presented, which is missing parts. So if the presented argument is only the general premise, then the other premise and conclusion are missing. But how can we represent that in the computational form? The task says to "infer the missing components". So perhaps we have to assume that the argument is being used in a context where the specific occurrence is given, and thus we can instantiate it. However, without additional information, this is challenging. Alternatively, maybe the user's text is the entire argument, but it's a different scheme. Let me check other schemes. For example, the Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is about pursuing renewable energy needing investment in solar. But the user's text is about investing leading to improvement. Doesn't seem to fit.

The Moral Justification Ad Populum scheme: involves everybody who is Y accepts P, and X's goal is Y, so X should accept P. Doesn't fit.

Position to Know: someone in a position to know asserts something. Not applicable here.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: involves vague properties. Not relevant.

Double Standard: involves applying different standards. No.

Argument from Opposites: fire and ice. Not relevant.

Need for Help: would_help, can_carry_out, not_too_costly. Doesn't fit.

Classification: like eagles being birds. Not this.

Analogy based on Classification: features leading to classification. Not this.

So the most likely scheme is Effect to Cause. But how to represent the user's text in that scheme. The user's text is "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." So this is the followed premise. If this is part of the premises, then the other premise is that the company did invest, leading to the conclusion that performance improves. But in the user's text, only the general rule is given. So maybe the presented argument is only the general rule, and the conclusion is missing. But the example's structure requires both premises. Therefore, perhaps the user's text is missing the specific premise and the conclusion, and we need to infer them. However, since the task requires instantiating all variables and predicates from the scheme, given the enthymeme, maybe the user's text is the followed premise, and the missing parts are the occurred(A) and the conclusion. But without knowing the specific company or instance, how to instantiate? Wait, in the example, the company is just 'company', not a specific name. So perhaps we can represent the company as a general term. So the premises would be:

- occurred(invest(company, employee_training))
- followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), improve(employee_performance))

Conclusion: improve(employee_performance)

But the user's text is only the second premise. However, the task says the enthymeme might be missing a premise or conclusion. So the user's text is part of the premises. To make it a complete argument, we need to add the other premise and the conclusion. But since the user's text is the enthymeme, which is missing parts, the task is to infer those missing parts. So perhaps the user is presenting an argument where the general rule is stated, and the conclusion is that if a company wants to improve performance, they should invest in training. But that would fit a different scheme, like Necessary Condition. Let me check that scheme again. Necessary Condition scheme is [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is: goal is pursuing renewable energy, necessary condition is investing in solar, therefore necessary to invest. So if the user's argument was structured as "To improve performance, investing in training is necessary. We need to improve performance. Therefore, we must invest." Then it would fit. But the user's text is a general "if A then B", not stating a goal. So probably not.

Back to Effect to Cause. If the user's text is the general rule (followed), then the full argument would need the occurred(A) and the conclusion occurs(B). But in the given text, these are missing. However, the task says to "infer the missing components" from the enthymeme. So perhaps the intended argument is using the general rule as one premise, and there's an implicit occurred(A) and conclusion. For example, if the argument is: "Generally, if a company invests in training, performance improves. Our company has invested in training. Therefore, our performance will improve." But the user's text only includes the first premise. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the other premise and conclusion. But the task requires us to instantiate all variables and predicates. Without specific information about the company, we can't know, but maybe in the computational form, we can use variables or a generic company. The example uses 'company' as a constant, not a variable. So perhaps in this case, the occurred(A) is invest(company, employee_training), and the conclusion is improve(employee_performance). But how to represent this? Let's structure it.

The Effect to Cause scheme's premises are:

1. occurred(A)
2. followed(occurred(A), occurs(B))

Conclusion: occurs(B)

In the user's text, the second premise is given: followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), occurs(improve(employee_performance)). The first premise, occurred(A), is missing. So the full computational form would be:

[occured(invest(company, employee_training)), followed(occured(invest(company, employee_training)), occurs(improve(employee_performance))], occurs(improve(employee_performance))

But the user's text is only the followed part. However, since the task is to infer the missing components, perhaps the user's text is part of the premises, and the other premise and conclusion are inferred. But how can we infer that a company has invested? Maybe the example in the context for Effect to Cause includes both premises, and the user's text is the general part. But without the specific case, we can't complete it. Unless the user's text is considered as the entire premise, which would not fit the scheme. Alternatively, perhaps the user's text is not a full argument but a single premise, but the task says it's an enthymeme, which is an argument with missing parts. So we need to figure out what's missing.

Wait, maybe the user's text is presented as the entire argument, but it's missing the conclusion. For example, "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve. Therefore, employee performance will improve." But that's not valid unless there's a premise that the company did invest. Alternatively, the argument could be modus ponens: If A then B. A. Therefore B. But the user's text is only the "If A then B" part. So the enthymeme is missing "A" and "therefore B". So the computational form would need to include occurred(A), the followed(A,B), and the conclusion B. But since the user's text is only the followed(A,B), we have to infer that A occurred and B is the conclusion. But without knowing A, how? Unless the variables are left as placeholders. However, in the example, specific terms are used. So perhaps the user's text is part of the premises, and the other premise and conclusion are inferred, but we need to instantiate them with the same structure. 

Let me try to model this. The user's text is the followed premise. The other premise is occurred(A), where A is the company investing. The conclusion is occurs(B), which is improved performance. So the computational form would be:

[occured(invest(company, employee_training), followed(occured(invest(company, employee_training)), occurs(improve(employee_performance))], occurs(improve(employee_performance))

But how do we know that the company actually invested? Since the user's text doesn't mention it, perhaps the enthymeme is missing that premise. However, the task says to infer the missing components. Therefore, we need to assume that the missing premise is present in the context. But since we don't have additional context, perhaps the user's text is part of an argument where the premises are the general rule and the occurred(A), leading to the conclusion. But the user's text only provides the general rule. So, perhaps the correct answer is to recognize that the argument uses the Effect to Cause scheme, with the given premise being the followed part, and the missing premise is occurred(A) and the conclusion. But to instantiate it, we need to fill in the variables. However, without specific information, perhaps we can represent the variables as they are in the user's text.

Wait, the example uses 'company' as a constant. So in the user's case, the company is a general entity. Therefore, the premises would be:

- occurred(invest(company, employee_training))
- followed(occurred(invest(company, employee_training)), improve(employee_performance))

Conclusion: improve(employee_performance)

But the user's text is only the second premise. However, the task is to infer the missing parts. Since the enthymeme is missing the first premise and the conclusion, but we need to fully instantiate the scheme, we have to include them. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(invest(company,employee_training), followed(occured(invest(company,employee_training)),improves(employee_performance)],improves(employee_performance)

But the user's text is "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve." So the 'improves' should be 'improve'? Or is it a predicate like increases in the example. Let me check the example again. In the Effect to Cause example, the conclusion is increases(company,customer_satisfaction). The predicate is 'increases'. So in the user's case, the predicate might be 'improves(company,employee_performance)'? But the user's text says "employee performance will improve." So maybe 'improves(employee_performance)'. But in the example, the predicate is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)'. So perhaps 'improves(employee_performance)' is the predicate, but it's better to model it as 'improves(company, employee_performance)'. Let me think. The example has increases(company,customer_satisfaction), which is a two-place predicate: the subject (company) and what's increasing. Similarly, in the user's case, the company is the one whose employee performance improves. So the predicate should be improves(company, employee_performance). But in the user's text, it's "employee performance will improve", which is a one-place predicate. However, in the example, 'increases' takes two arguments: the company and the satisfaction. So perhaps to be consistent, the user's predicate should also take two arguments. Therefore, the conclusion would be improves(company, employee_performance). Then the followed premise would be followed(occurred(invest(company,employee_training)), improves(company, employee_performance)). 

But in the user's text, the statement is "employee performance will improve" without specifying the company. However, since the antecedent is "a company invests", the company is the subject. So maybe the predicate should include the company. Therefore, the correct form would be:

[occured(invest(company,employee_training)), followed(occured(invest(company,employee_training)), improves(company, employee_performance))], improves(company, employee_performance))

But the example uses 'increases(company,customer_satisfaction)', so it's a two-place predicate. Therefore, the user's case should follow the same structure. 

Putting it all together, the user's text corresponds to the Effect to Cause scheme. The given premise is the followed part, and the missing premise is the occurred(invest(...)) and the conclusion. Therefore, the computational form is:

[occured(invest(company,employee_training)), followed(occured(invest(company,employee_training)), improves(company,employee_performance))], improves(company,employee_performance)

But the user's text is only the 'followed' part. However, since the task is to infer the missing components, we need to include all parts. Therefore, the final computational argument should have both premises and the conclusion, even if the user's text only provides one premise. 

But wait, the user's text is the entire argument presented, which is an enthymeme. So perhaps in the actual argument, the conclusion is missing. For example, the argument is: "Generally, if a company invests in employee training, then employee performance will improve. Therefore, employee performance will improve." But this is missing the premise that the company did invest. However, if the argument is presented as such, then it's invalid. But the task is to infer the missing parts. So maybe the enthymeme is missing the premise that the company invested, and the conclusion is that their performance improves. Therefore, the full computational form would include occurred(invest(company,...)), followed(...), and the conclusion. 

But without knowing which company, we have to assume a general company, as in the example. Therefore, the final answer should be:

[occured(invest(company,employee_training)), followed(occured(invest(company,employee_training)),improves(company,employee_performance))],improves(company,employee_performance)


Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user gave an enthymeme: "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." They want me to translate this into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the provided context.

First, I need to recall the different schemes in the context. The options include analogy based on classification, effect to cause, need for help, opposites, moral justification ad populum, classification, necessary condition, position to know, double standard, vagueness of verbal classification, and others.

Looking at the example given for the Effect to Cause scheme: [occured(A),followed(occured(A),occurs(B))],occurs(B). The example was about a company providing good service leading to increased satisfaction. The structure is that if A occurs and A is followed by B, then B occurs.

The text here is "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." So the conclusion is missing. The enthymeme probably assumes that following the recipe leads to a certain outcome, like the dish being good. But the user hasn't provided the conclusion. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the enthymeme might have a missing premise or conclusion. So the given text might be a premise, and the conclusion is implied.

Looking at the Effect to Cause example, the premises are that A occurred and that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B occurs. So if the recipe is followed (A occurred), and following the recipe leads to a successful dish (B), then the conclusion is the dish is successful.

But in the given text, the premise is that the recipe is followed accurately. The missing part would be the other premise (the general rule that following the recipe causes the desired outcome) and the conclusion (the outcome occurs).

Wait, but in the Effect to Cause scheme as per the context, the scheme is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So the premises are that A occurred, and A is followed by B. Then B occurs.

So in the given text: "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." That's the occured(A) part. But where is the followed(A, B) part? The user's text only provides one premise. So maybe the enthymeme is missing the other premise that following the recipe leads to the desired result, and the conclusion is that the desired result occurs.

But the user's text is just the one sentence. So perhaps the example is similar to the Effect to Cause example where they have the general premise and the specific. Wait, in the example, the first sentence is the general rule: "if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase." Then the specific case: "the company provides excellent customer service." Therefore, conclusion: satisfaction increases.

So the structure is: General rule (if A then B), specific occurrence of A, therefore B. But in the computational form, it's represented as [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So maybe the general rule is encapsulated in the 'followed' predicate.

But in the example given, the computational form is [occured(provides(...)), followed(occured(...), increases(...))], increases(...). So the 'followed' predicate links the occurrence of A to B.

In the current text, the premise is that the recipe was followed accurately (occurred(A)), and the missing premise would be that following the recipe (A) is followed by the desired outcome (B). Therefore, the conclusion is B occurs.

But the user's text only says "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." So the missing parts are the general premise (following the recipe leads to the outcome) and the conclusion (the outcome occurs). But how is this structured in the scheme?

The Effect to Cause scheme requires two premises: occurred(A) and followed(occurred(A), occurs(B)). Then the conclusion is occurs(B).

So in the given text, the user only provides occurred(A). The other premise followed(A, B) and the conclusion are missing. But the task is to translate the given argument, which is an enthymeme, so we have to infer the missing parts based on the scheme.

Wait, but maybe the text is part of a larger argument where the conclusion is implied. For example, if the full argument is: "If the recipe is followed accurately, the dish will turn out well. In this case, the recipe was followed accurately. Therefore, the dish turned out well." Then the given text is the second premise and the conclusion is missing.

But the user's text is just "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." So maybe the original argument has that as a premise, and the conclusion is the effect (the dish is good), but the general premise (if recipe is followed, then dish is good) is missing. However, the computational form requires both premises. So the user's text is one premise, and we need to infer the other premise and conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended scheme is different. Let me check other schemes. For example, the Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). Doesn't seem to fit here.

The Classification scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). Like, all eagles are birds, white eagles are eagles, so white eagles are birds. Not matching.

Position to Know: if someone is in a position to know and asserts something, then that's the conclusion. Doesn't fit.

Double Standard: applying different standards. Not relevant here.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: about ambiguous terms leading to rejection. No.

So the Effect to Cause seems plausible. The user's text is the occurred(A) premise. The missing parts are the followed(A, B) premise and the conclusion occurs(B).

But the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing. The task is to translate the given argument into the computational form by instantiating all variables and predicates from the scheme. So perhaps the given text is the occurred(A) part, and we need to infer the followed(A,B) and the conclusion. But how?

Wait, in the example provided for Effect to Cause, the argument is structured as:

Premise 1: Generally, if A, then B.

Premise 2: A occurred.

Conclusion: Therefore, B.

But in the computational form, it's represented as [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B).

So the 'followed' predicate represents the general rule that A's occurrence is followed by B's occurrence.

In the user's text, the premise is "the recipe is followed accurately" which is occured(A). Then the missing premise is the followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), and the conclusion is occurs(B).

But the problem is that the user's text only gives one premise. The other premise and the conclusion are missing. So to form the computational argument, we need to represent the given premise and the missing ones, but since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the general premise is assumed and not stated, and the conclusion is missing.

But the task says "FULLY instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

Therefore, the user's text is "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." So this is the occurred(A) part. The scheme requires two premises: occurred(A) and followed(occurred(A), occurs(B)), leading to conclusion occurs(B).

But to instantiate this, we need to infer A and B. The A here is "the recipe is followed accurately". Then B would be the effect, which isn't stated. But perhaps in the enthymeme, the conclusion is implicit. For example, the full argument might be: "Following the recipe accurately leads to a good dish. In this case, the recipe was followed accurately. Therefore, the dish is good." But the given text only includes the second premise. So how do we handle this?

Wait, the example in the context for Effect to Cause had the two premises and conclusion. The user's text here is only one premise. But in the problem statement, the user says that the text is an enthymeme, so parts are missing.

But the task is to translate the given argument (the enthymeme) into the computational form, which requires all premises and conclusion as per the scheme. So perhaps the enthymeme only provides one premise, and we need to infer the other premise and conclusion.

But how can we do that? For example, the given premise is occurred(A). The other premise is followed(occurred(A), occurs(B)), and conclusion occurs(B). So A is the action of following the recipe accurately, B is the outcome (like the dish being successful). But since the text doesn't mention B, we have to assume that the conclusion is B, and the followed premise is implicit.

But the variables and predicates must be instantiated. So the A would be following_recipe_accurately (or similar), and B would be desired_outcome (or similar). But how to represent this in the computational form.

Alternatively, maybe the example uses specific terms. Let's look at the example again:

Example 1: Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase.

Computational form: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the occurred(A) is provides(company, excellent_customer_service). The followed predicate links occurred(A) to increases(...). The conclusion is increases(...).

In the user's text, the occurred(A) is "the recipe is followed accurately." So in logical terms, that's occurred(follow_accurately(recipe)).

Then the followed predicate would link occurred(follow_accurately(recipe)) to occurs(B), where B is the effect, like dish_success.

But since the text doesn't mention B, we have to infer it. But the task requires fully instantiating all variables. Therefore, perhaps the effect is implied, but we need to represent it with placeholders?

Wait, no. The user's instruction says: "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

So even if the enthymeme is missing parts, we need to infer them based on the scheme.

But in this case, the enthymeme is only one premise. So to fit into the Effect to Cause scheme, we need two premises and a conclusion.

Assuming that the text is part of an argument where the conclusion is missing, and the other premise is also missing. For example:

Premise 1: Following the recipe accurately leads to a good dish. (followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(good_dish))

Premise 2: In this case, the recipe was followed accurately. (occured(follow_accurately(recipe)))

Conclusion: Therefore, the dish is good. (occurs(good_dish))

But the user's text only provides Premise 2. However, the task is to translate the given argument (which is the enthymeme) into the computational form by inferring the missing components. So we need to represent all parts of the scheme, even if they are missing in the text, based on what's implied.

But how to determine B? Since the text doesn't mention the effect, but the scheme requires it, perhaps we need to represent it as variables. Wait, but the example in the context uses specific terms. For instance, in the example, A is "provides(company, excellent_customer_service)" and B is "increases(company, customer_satisfaction)".

In the user's case, A is "follow_accurately(recipe)", and B would be the effect, which isn't stated. But since the enthymeme is missing parts, we need to infer B. However, without more context, it's impossible to know what B is. Therefore, maybe the user's example is incomplete, and the answer should use placeholders.

Wait, but the user's example in the context for Effect to Cause has the specific terms. So perhaps in the given case, the effect is implied. For example, the full argument might be: "Following the recipe accurately leads to the desired outcome. In this case, the recipe was followed accurately. Therefore, the desired outcome occurs." But the user's text only provides the second premise. However, the instruction says that the text is an enthymeme, so we need to infer the missing parts.

Alternatively, maybe the text provided is the entire argument, but it's missing parts. For example, "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately. Therefore, [effect occurs]." So the missing premise is the general rule, and the conclusion is the effect. But how to represent this.

But according to the Effect to Cause scheme, we need both premises: occurred(A) and followed(A, B). Then conclusion is occurs(B). So the computational form would be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(desired_outcome))], occurs(desired_outcome)

But the problem is that the desired_outcome is not mentioned in the text. So how can we instantiate it?

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is mentioned in the context. Wait, the original text is "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." Maybe the conclusion is that the dish is cooked properly, but it's not stated. However, since the task requires us to instantiate all variables, perhaps we need to use the predicates as per the example, replacing with the terms from the given text.

But the given text doesn't mention the effect. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is to represent the effect as a variable, but the example in the context uses specific terms. Alternatively, perhaps the effect is implied by the action. For example, following the recipe leads to the recipe being completed correctly. But that seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is the successful execution of the recipe. So the predicates would be:

occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(recipe_success)), and the conclusion is occurs(recipe_success).

But the text doesn't mention that. However, as per the instructions, we need to infer the missing components. So the user's text is the premise occurred(A), and we need to infer that the other premise is followed(A, B) and the conclusion is B.

But how to name B? In the example, the effect was increases(company, customer_satisfaction). For the recipe case, the effect could be achieves_desired_result(recipe). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is the successful outcome of following the recipe. So in the computational form:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(successful_outcome))], occurs(successful_outcome)

But the variables here are not grounded. However, the example in the context uses specific terms. For instance, in the example, A is 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)' and B is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)'.

In the given text, the action is following the recipe accurately. So 'follow_accurately(recipe)' is A. The effect B must be the result of A. If the recipe is for a dish, then the effect might be 'dish_prepared_successfully'.

But how to represent this. Maybe:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(dish_success))], occurs(dish_success)

But the text doesn't mention the dish or success. However, since it's an enthymeme, we have to infer these parts based on context.

Alternatively, maybe the effect is implied by the action. Following a recipe accurately would result in the recipe being executed correctly. So B is 'correct_execution'.

But this is still ambiguous. The key is to follow the example's structure. The example uses specific terms related to the context. For the recipe, the effect could be 'successful_dish' or 'correct_outcome'.

But without more information, I have to make an educated guess. The important part is to structure it according to the Effect to Cause scheme.

So the computational form would be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(successful_outcome))], occurs(successful_outcome)

But to match the example's style, perhaps using more specific terms. For instance, if the recipe is for baking a cake, the effect would be the cake being baked correctly. But since the recipe isn't specified, maybe the effect is 'desired_result'.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is 'dish_prepared_correctly', and the action is 'following_recipe_accurately'.

Wait, the example uses 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)' as the action, and 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)' as the effect. So the effect is a result of the action.

In the recipe case, the action is following the recipe, and the effect is the desired outcome of the recipe. So maybe 'desired_outcome(recipe)'.

So the predicates would be:

occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(desired_outcome(recipe))), and the conclusion is occurs(desired_outcome(recipe)).

But in the example, the effect is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)', which is a predicate. So perhaps in this case, the effect is 'desired_outcome_achieved'.

Alternatively, maybe the effect is 'recipe_executed_successfully'.

But I think the safest way is to mirror the example's structure. In the example, the action is 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)', and the effect is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)'.

So in the current case, the action is 'follow_accurately(recipe)', and the effect is 'achieves_desired_result(recipe)'.

Thus, the computational form would be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), achieves_desired_result(recipe))], achieves_desired_result(recipe)

But I'm not sure if 'achieves_desired_result' is the right predicate. Alternatively, maybe 'dish_success' or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is 'correct_preparation', so:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), correct_preparation)), correct_preparation

But the example uses 'increases(...)' which is a verb. So maybe the effect should be a verb phrase.

Alternatively, using 'successful_execution'.

But without explicit information, I need to make a best guess. The key is to follow the structure of the Effect to Cause scheme.

Thus, the final answer should be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(successful_outcome))], occurs(successful_outcome)

But the example uses specific terms. Maybe the effect is 'dish_prepared_properly'.

Alternatively, since the example uses a predicate with arguments (company and customer_satisfaction), maybe here it's 'outcome_achieved(recipe)'.

But I think the user's text is so minimal that the intended answer is to recognize that the given premise is 'occured(A)', and the missing parts are 'followed(A, B)' and 'occurs(B)', with B being inferred as the desired effect. But how to represent B as a term.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is implied by the action. Following a recipe accurately's effect is the intended dish being made. So 'dish_made_successfully'.

But again, this is speculative. The key is to map to the Effect to Cause scheme and use the structure from the example.

In the example, the premises are:

1. occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service))
2. followed(occured(provides(...)), increases(...))

Conclusion: increases(...)

So applying this structure to the user's case:

Premise 1: occured(follow_accurately(recipe))

Premise 2: followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(effect))

Conclusion: occurs(effect)

But the problem is naming 'effect'. The example uses 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)', which is a specific effect. In the user's case, the effect could be 'prepared_successfully(dish)'.

But the text doesn't mention a dish. It just mentions the recipe. So maybe the effect is 'recipe_executed_successfully'.

Alternatively, using 'achieves_intended_result'.

But the example uses a more direct cause-effect. The company providing service leads to increased satisfaction. Similarly, following the recipe leads to the desired outcome.

Thus, the computational form would be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), achieves(recipe, desired_outcome))], achieves(recipe, desired_outcome)

But I'm not sure. The example uses 'occured(A)' and 'followed(A, B)', where B is a predicate. In the example, B is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)'.

In the user's case, A is 'follow_accurately(recipe)', and B is the effect, which we need to name. Maybe 'preparation_success'.

Alternatively, using 'successful_execution'.

But the main thing is to follow the structure. The answer must be in the exact format, so I need to make sure the predicates are correctly instantiated.

Given the example, the structure is:

[occured(action), followed(occured(action), effect)], effect

So for the user's case:

action = follow_accurately(recipe)

effect = successful_outcome

Thus:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), successful_outcome)], successful_outcome

But the example uses more specific terms, like 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)' and 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)'.

Alternatively, maybe the effect is 'preparation_correct', but I'm not sure. The key is that the user's text belongs to the Effect to Cause scheme, and the computational form should reflect that.

Another angle: The user's text is "In this case, the recipe is followed accurately." This is similar to the example's second premise: "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." The example's conclusion is "customer satisfaction will increase." So in the user's case, the conclusion would be the effect that follows from following the recipe accurately.

But without knowing the specific effect, how can we represent it? Perhaps the effect is implied by the action, but we need to use a placeholder. However, the example uses specific terms. Maybe the intended answer is that the effect is 'the_dish_turns_out_well' or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the effect is 'correct_execution', leading to:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), correct_execution)], correct_execution

But the example's effect is an increase in satisfaction, which is a result. So maybe 'correct_outcome'.

But I'm stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the structure as per the example, replacing their terms with the user's terms.

In the example:

occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service))

followed(occured(provides(...)), increases(...))

So in the user's case:

occured(follow_accurately(recipe))

followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(successful_outcome))

Conclusion: occurs(successful_outcome)

Thus, the computational form would be:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), occurs(successful_outcome))], occurs(successful_outcome)

But I'm not sure if 'occurs' is part of the predicate. In the example, the effect is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)', which is a predicate without 'occurs'. Wait, in the example's computational form, it's:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the followed predicate is followed(occured(A), B), and the conclusion is B. So in the user's case, B would be the effect predicate.

So perhaps the effect is 'dish_prepared_successfully' or 'recipe_executed_correctly'.

But since the text doesn't mention the dish, maybe the effect is 'desired_result_achieved'.

Thus:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), desired_result_achieved)], desired_result_achieved

This follows the structure where the effect is a predicate that is the conclusion.

But the example uses a more complex predicate (increases(...)), so maybe the effect here is more specific.

Alternatively, maybe the effect is 'correct_outcome'.

But given the lack of specific information, I think the intended answer is to recognize that the argument uses the Effect to Cause scheme, with the given premise as occurred(A), and the other premise and conclusion inferred.

Thus, the answer is:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), correct_outcome)], correct_outcome

But to match the example's style, the effect should be a predicate like 'dish_success'.

But since the recipe's outcome isn't specified, perhaps the correct conclusion is that the recipe's intended outcome occurs. So:

[occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), followed(occured(follow_accurately(recipe)), intended_outcome_achieved)], intended_outcome_achieved

I think this is the best possible way to instantiate it based on the given information.


Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user provided an argument in natural language: "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." They want me to translate this into a computational form using the appropriate argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme this belongs to. Let me look at the examples provided in the context.

Looking at the Effect to Cause example: The structure there is that if something occurs (A), and if A is followed by B, then B occurs. The example given is about customer service leading to increased satisfaction. The structure here seems to be a general rule (if A then B) followed by an instance of A leading to B. The premise is that A occurs, and since A is followed by B, B occurs.

The given text here is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." This seems like a general statement where effective collaboration (A) leads to achieving goals (B). However, the argumentation scheme for Effect to Cause in the example requires two premises: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], and the conclusion is occurs(B). 

Wait, in the example, the premises are that the company provides excellent service (A occurred), and that providing excellent service is followed by increased satisfaction. Then the conclusion is that satisfaction increases. The natural language argument given here is stating the general rule, but maybe the full argument would need an instance where A occurred, leading to B. However, the text provided is just the general statement. But perhaps this is an enthymeme where the missing premise is the occurrence of A. Wait, no, the user said the text is an enthymeme where either the conclusion or premises might be missing.

But the text provided here is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." That seems like a general rule, not an argument with premises and conclusion. Maybe the example in the context for Effect to Cause has a structure where the first premise is the occurrence of the cause (A occurred) and the second is that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B occurs. So in the example, "the company provides excellent customer service" is A, and "customer satisfaction will increase" is B. The general statement is part of the scheme as the 'followed' predicate.

Wait, the Effect to Cause scheme is structured as [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example includes the general premise (if A then B) as part of the 'followed' predicate. So in the example, the first premise is that A occurred (providing excellent service), and the second is that A is followed by B (if a company provides excellent service, then satisfaction increases). Then the conclusion is B occurs.

So applying that to the given text: "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." This seems like the 'followed' part. But the argument would need the premise that the team did collaborate effectively (A occurred), and then the conclusion would be that they achieved their goals. However, the text provided is only the general statement. But since it's an enthymeme, maybe the missing part is the premise that the team did collaborate effectively, and the conclusion that they achieved their goals. But the text provided is just the general rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user's text is the general statement, and the full argument would be: "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals. In this case, the team collaborates effectively. Therefore, they will achieve their goals." That would fit the Effect to Cause scheme. So the given text is the first part (the followed premise), and the missing parts are the occurrence of A (team collaborates) and the conclusion B (achieve goals). But the user's text only includes the general statement. However, since it's an enthymeme, the user's text might be the major premise, and the minor premise and conclusion are missing. But the task is to translate the given argument (which is an enthymeme) into the computational form by inferring the missing components. So if the text provided is the general rule (the followed part), then perhaps the actual argument is being presented with the general rule and the occurrence of A, leading to B. Wait, but in the example, the major premise is part of the 'followed' predicate.

Wait, let's look at the Effect to Cause example again:

Example 1: "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase."

Computational form: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

Wait, the user wrote the example's computational form as [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction). But the commas and parentheses might be off. Let me check again.

In the example, the premises are:

1. occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service))

2. followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))

Conclusion: increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the first premise is that the company provided excellent service (A occurred). The second is that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B.

In the given text, the user's argument is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." This is the general statement, which would correspond to the 'followed' part. But to form a complete argument using the Effect to Cause scheme, we need two premises: the occurrence of A and that A is followed by B, leading to B. Since the text provided is only the general rule (the followed part), it's missing the premise that A occurred. But the user says the enthymeme may be missing premises or conclusion. So perhaps in this case, the text is only presenting the general rule, and the actual argument (as an enthymeme) is missing the specific instance. But the task is to infer the missing parts based on the given text. Wait, the user instruction says: "translate the given argument to a computational form... by inferring the missing components." So the text provided is the enthymeme, which might be missing parts. For example, if the text were "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase," then the missing premise is the general rule. But in the given case, the text is the general rule. So maybe the argument is presented as "Generally, if A then B. Therefore, B occurs." But that's not valid. Wait, no. The example includes both the general rule and the specific instance. So if the given text is only the general statement, then perhaps the argument is missing the specific instance. But the user says that the text is an enthymeme where parts are missing. So perhaps the actual argument is using the general statement as a premise and then in the context of an argument, the other premise and conclusion are implied. But without more information, how can we fill in the blanks? The user's text is just "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." That's a single statement. To form an argument using the Effect to Cause scheme, we need two premises: occurrence of A and followed(A,B). Then conclusion B. So perhaps the enthymeme here is missing the occurrence of A and the conclusion. But how to infer that? Wait, maybe the user's text is part of a larger argument where the other premise is given. But in the problem, the text provided is only that single sentence. So maybe the computational form requires that the 'followed' predicate is the only premise, but according to the scheme, it needs both 'occured(A)' and 'followed(A,B)'. Therefore, perhaps the given text is only the 'followed' part, but the enthymeme is missing the 'occured(A)' premise and the conclusion. However, the user says that the answer must instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. So I need to see what is present and what is missing. The text given is the general rule, which in the example is part of the 'followed' predicate. So perhaps the full argument would be: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So in this case, the enthymeme is missing the occurrence of A and the conclusion. But how to infer those? Maybe the variables can be filled in from the given text. Let's parse the given text: "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." The 'if A then B' is the followed part. So A is "team collaborates effectively" and B is "they will achieve their goals". But in the computational form, 'occured(A)' is a premise. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the premise that the team did collaborate effectively (A occurred), leading to the conclusion that they achieved their goals (B). Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(team_collaborates_effectively), followed(occured(team_collaborates_effectively), achieves_goals(team))], achieves_goals(team)

But the given text only includes the 'followed' part. However, since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the user is expecting that the missing premise and conclusion are inferred. Wait, but in the example, the computational form includes both premises: the occurrence and the followed statement. The given text here is just the followed statement, so maybe the rest is missing. But how can we infer the occurrence of A? Unless the enthymeme is presented as a general rule without a specific instance. But maybe in this case, the argument is structured with the general rule (followed) but the occurrence is assumed. But that's not valid. For example, the example's first premise is that the company provides excellent service (A occurred), and the second is the followed by B. The conclusion is B. In the given text, we only have the followed by B part. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the occurrence of A. But how can we translate this into the computational form without knowing A? The variables need to be instantiated. Wait, maybe the given text is part of a larger argument where the occurrence of A is given elsewhere, but since we only have this sentence, perhaps the answer is to recognize that this is the 'followed' part of the Effect to Cause scheme, but without the occurrence of A. But the user instruction says to "infer the missing components". So perhaps the user expects that the missing premise is the occurrence of A, and the conclusion is B. But since the text is only the general statement, maybe it's part of a hypothetical. Alternatively, perhaps the text is an incomplete argument that's missing the specific instance. For example, if someone says "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals. Therefore, they should collaborate effectively." But that would be a different scheme. Alternatively, maybe the text is part of a modus ponens argument, but in the example, the Effect to Cause scheme requires the occurrence of A and followed(A,B). So in the given text, the user has only provided the followed(A,B) part. But the argument is incomplete. However, the task says that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing, and we need to infer the missing parts. So perhaps the text provided is the major premise (the followed part), and the minor premise (A occurred) and conclusion (B) are missing. But how can we instantiate variables for them? Maybe the variables in the computational form are:

For the Effect to Cause scheme:

Premises:

1. occured(A)

2. followed(occured(A), occurs(B))

Conclusion: occurs(B)

In the given text, the followed part is provided: followed(occured(A), occurs(B)) where A is team collaborating effectively and B is achieving goals. The missing premise is occured(A), but without context, can we assume that A has occurred? The enthymeme might be missing the premise that the team did collaborate effectively, leading to the conclusion that they achieved their goals. So the full argument would be:

Premise 1: The team collaborated effectively (occured(team_collaborates_effectively))

Premise 2: If a team collaborates effectively, then they achieve their goals (followed(occured(team_collaborates_effectively), achieves_goals(team)))

Conclusion: Therefore, the team achieved their goals (achieves_goals(team))

Thus, the computational form would be:

[occured(team_collaborates_effectively), followed(occured(team_collaborates_effectively), achieves_goals(team))], achieves_goals(team)

But the given text only includes the second premise (the followed part). So to make this an enthymeme, the user's text is providing the general rule (premise 2), and the other premise (premise 1) and conclusion are missing. However, the instruction says that the text is the enthymeme, so perhaps the text is the entire argument, but parts are missing. Wait, the user's text is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." Which is just the general statement. So the user's argument, as an enthymeme, is missing the specific instance where the team did collaborate effectively and the conclusion that they achieved their goals. But how can we infer that from just the general statement? Unless there's an implicit specific case being referred to, but there's no mention of it in the text. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is a different scheme. Let me check other schemes. For example, the Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is about needing to invest in solar power to pursue renewable energy. But the given text is about collaboration leading to achieving goals, which is a causal relationship, not a necessary condition. The Effect to Cause seems more appropriate.

Wait, the example of Effect to Cause in the context is structured as:

Premise 1: A occurred (company provides excellent service)

Premise 2: If A occurs, then B occurs (followed(occured(A), B)

Conclusion: B occurs.

So the given text here is Premise 2. The enthymeme is missing Premise 1 and the Conclusion. But how can we instantiate variables for them without knowing the specific instance? The variables in the scheme are A and B. In the given text, A is "team collaborates effectively" and B is "achieve their goals". So the missing Premise 1 would be that the team did collaborate effectively (occured(team_collaborates_effectively)), and the conclusion is that they achieved their goals (achieves_goals(team)). But the text doesn't mention a specific team or instance. However, perhaps the variables are more abstract. For example, A is the action of collaborating effectively, and B is the result of achieving goals. So the computational form would be:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieves_goals(team)))], achieves_goals(team)

But how to represent this. Let me think about the predicates. In the example, 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)' is the event A. So for the given text, A is the event of a team collaborating effectively, which can be represented as collaborate_effectively(team). Then, B is achieving their goals, which would be achieve_goals(team).

So the premises would be:

1. occured(collaborate_effectively(team))

2. followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))

Conclusion: achieve_goals(team)

But the text provided is only the second premise (the followed part). Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the first premise and the conclusion. The task is to infer the missing components. Since the text is the general rule, perhaps the user is assuming that the specific instance is implied. For example, if the argument is presented as "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals. Therefore, they should collaborate effectively." But that would be a different scheme. Alternatively, maybe the argument is structured as a hypothetical, but the Effect to Cause scheme requires the occurrence of A. 

But given that the text is the general statement, and the user says to infer the missing parts, I have to assume that there's a specific instance where A occurred, leading to B. However, since there's no mention of a specific team or event in the text, how can we instantiate the variables? Maybe the variables are generic. For example, the team is a variable, but in the computational form, they might be represented as a constant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of a larger argument where the specific team is mentioned elsewhere, but since we only have this sentence, we can only use the general terms. But in the example, the specific company is used. So maybe in this case, the team is a specific team, but it's not named. However, the problem says to instantiate all variables and predicates. So perhaps the team is represented as a general term. 

Alternatively, maybe the predicates are structured differently. For instance, in the example, the followed predicate is followed(occured(A), B), where B is the effect. So for the given text, A is collaborate_effectively(team), and B is achieve_goals(team). So the premises would be:

occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), 

followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team)), 

Conclusion: achieve_goals(team)

But the text only provides the second premise. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the first premise and the conclusion. The user expects us to infer those. However, the problem states that the text is the enthymeme provided, so we must use it to infer the missing parts. 

Given that, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the given text corresponds to the 'followed' premise of the Effect to Cause scheme. The missing parts are the occurrence of A and the conclusion B. Therefore, the computational form should have both premises and the conclusion, even though the text only states the 'followed' part. But how to structure this? 

Wait, in the example, the 'followed' predicate is part of the premise. The user's text is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." This is the 'followed' part. So the computational form should have:

[occured(A), followed(occured(A), B)], B

Where A is collaborate_effectively(team) and B is achieve_goals(team). But in the example, the followed predicate is structured as followed(occured(A), B). So the variables here need to be instantiated. 

Therefore, the answer would be:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))], achieve_goals(team)

But wait, the problem says that the text is the enthymeme, which might be missing premises or the conclusion. So the text provided is "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals." This corresponds to the 'followed' premise. The missing premise is the occurrence of A (the team collaborating effectively), and the conclusion is B (they achieve goals). Therefore, the computational form should include all premises (including the missing one inferred) and the conclusion. 

But how can we infer the occurrence of A? Unless the text is part of a larger argument where A is given. But since we only have this sentence, maybe we can't infer a specific occurrence of A. But the user instruction says to infer the missing components. So perhaps the enthymeme is assuming that the team did collaborate effectively, leading to the conclusion. But the text doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is a standalone statement, but it's part of the Effect to Cause scheme. However, without the occurrence of A, it's not a complete argument. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, let's look at another example. In the example for Effect to Cause, the major premise is "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase." The minor premise is "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." Conclusion: "Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." So the given text here is similar to the major premise of the example. Therefore, the user's text is just the major premise, and the minor premise and conclusion are missing. So the computational form would be the same structure as the example, but with the variables replaced. 

So in the example, the premises are:

1. occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service))

2. followed(occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service)), increases(company, customer_satisfaction))

Conclusion: increases(company, customer_satisfaction)

In the user's text, the major premise is the 'followed' part. But to form the argument, we need the minor premise (A occurred) and the conclusion. However, the text provided is only the 'followed' part. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the minor premise and conclusion. So to instantiate the variables, we need to infer that there's a specific instance where A occurred. But without additional information, perhaps we can't. However, the task requires us to infer the missing components. So perhaps we assume that the argument is presented as follows: "Generally, if a team collaborates effectively, then they will achieve their goals. [The team collaborated effectively.] Therefore, they achieved their goals." The parts in brackets are missing. Therefore, in the computational form, the premises would include both the occurrence and the followed, and the conclusion. 

Thus, the computational form would be:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))], achieve_goals(team)

But how to represent collaborate_effectively and achieve_goals as predicates. In the example, the event is represented as provides(company, excellent_customer_service). So similarly, the event here is collaborate_effectively(team). The effect is achieve_goals(team). 

So the final answer should be:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))], achieve_goals(team)

But I need to check the formatting and ensure that predicates are correctly instantiated. The example uses predicates like provides(company, ...), so in this case, collaborate_effectively(team) would be the action. However, maybe the team is the subject, so the action is collaborate_effectively, and the team is the one doing it. Alternatively, maybe it's represented as action(agent, ...). But in the example, the action is provides(company, ...), so the agent is the company, the action is providing excellent service. So similarly, the team is the agent, and the action is collaborating effectively. 

Therefore, the correct predicates would be:

occured(collaborate_effectively(team))

followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))

Conclusion: achieve_goals(team)

But the example for Effect to Cause in the context uses the format [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). In the example, the second premise is followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), which in the example is followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction)). So the 'followed' predicate has two arguments: the event of A occurring, and the effect B. 

Therefore, in the user's case, A is collaborate_effectively(team), and B is achieve_goals(team). Thus, the computational form should be:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))], achieve_goals(team)

But we need to make sure that the predicates are correctly formatted. Also, note that in the example, the effect is increases(company,customer_satisfaction), which is a predicate with two arguments. Similarly, achieve_goals(team) could be a predicate with the team as the argument. 

So the final computational form is:

[occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), followed(occured(collaborate_effectively(team)), achieve_goals(team))], achieve_goals(team)

But wait, in the example, the second argument of followed is occurs(B), but in the example, the effect is increases(company,customer_satisfaction), which is a predicate. So maybe the correct way is to have B as the predicate. Therefore, in the user's case, B is achieve_goals(team). 

Yes, this seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be the Effect to Cause scheme, with the premises and conclusion as above.


Okay, let's see. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme. The given text is "In this case, the computer system is properly maintained." 

First, I need to figure out which argumentation scheme this belongs to. The context includes several schemes like Analogy, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Opposites, Moral Justification, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness, etc.

The example given in the Classification scheme is: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. The structure here is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], so be(A,G). The premises are about classification and then applying that classification to a specific instance.

The text here says "the computer system is properly maintained." The conclusion might be missing. But the premise given is about classification. Wait, in the Classification Argumentation scheme, the structure is classification(F,G), be(A,F) leading to be(A,G). 

Wait, the example in the Classification scheme is:

Example 1: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. The computational form is [classification(eagle,bird), be(white_eagle,eagle)], be(white_eagle,bird).

So the premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to conclusion be(A,G). 

But in the given text, the statement is "the computer system is properly maintained." This could be a premise where the computer system is classified as properly maintained. But maybe the conclusion is missing. Wait, the user said it's an enthymeme, so either a premise or conclusion is missing.

If the text is the conclusion, but I think the text is the premise. Wait, the user's instruction says that the enthymeme might have a missing conclusion or premises. So perhaps the example here is that "the computer system is properly maintained" is a premise, but what's the conclusion?

Alternatively, maybe the argument is that since the computer system is properly maintained (classified as such), then something follows. But looking at the Classification scheme's structure, it's about if A is classified as F, and F is classified as G, then A is G. Wait, no, the example given is that classification(eagle, bird) (all eagles are birds), and white_eagle is an eagle, so white_eagle is a bird. So the structure is a hierarchical classification.

But in the given text, there's only one premise: "the computer system is properly maintained." If this is the conclusion, then what's the missing premise? Or if it's a premise, then what's the conclusion?

Alternatively, maybe the argument is that because the computer system is properly maintained (a classification), then some other property follows. But according to the Classification scheme, the structure requires two premises: one that classifies a category into another, and then states that an instance belongs to the first category, leading to the conclusion that it belongs to the second.

Wait, the given text is "the computer system is properly maintained." If this is the conclusion, then the premises would be something like "All systems that are maintained are properly functioning," and "the computer system is maintained," leading to "the computer system is properly maintained." But the user's example for Classification is different. Let me check the example again.

In the Classification example, the premises are classification(eagle, bird) (i.e., all eagles are birds) and be(white_eagle, eagle) (white eagles are eagles), leading to the conclusion be(white_eagle, bird). So the scheme is about subsuming a subclass into a superclass.

In the user's text, if "properly maintained" is the conclusion, then perhaps the premises are that the computer system is part of a class that is properly maintained. But the text only has "the computer system is properly maintained." Maybe the enthymeme is missing the premises. For example, maybe the argument is: All systems that undergo regular maintenance are properly maintained. The computer system undergoes regular maintenance. Therefore, it is properly maintained. But in that case, the argument would fit the Classification scheme if the premises are classification(regular_maintenance_systems, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, regular_maintenance_systems). Then the conclusion is be(computer_system, properly_maintained). 

But the given text is only the conclusion part. Wait, no. The text provided is "In this case, the computer system is properly maintained." If this is the conclusion, then the missing premises would be the general classification and the specific instance. But the user might have presented the argument as a single premise with the conclusion missing. Alternatively, maybe the argument is presented as a conclusion with missing premises. Since the user says it's an enthymeme, either a premise or conclusion is missing.

But looking at the example in the Classification scheme, the computational form is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). So the two premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to be(A,G). 

If the given text is one of the premises, then perhaps the enthymeme is missing the other premise. For example, if the text is "the computer system is a system that undergoes regular maintenance" (be(computer_system, regular_maintenance_systems)), and the missing premise is classification(regular_maintenance_systems, properly_maintained), then the conclusion would be be(computer_system, properly_maintained). But the given text is "the computer system is properly maintained," which is the conclusion. So the user's text is the conclusion, and the premises are missing.

Alternatively, if the given text is the premise, then perhaps the conclusion is missing. But in that case, how does it fit the Classification scheme? Maybe the argument is that because the computer system is properly maintained (be(A,F)), and there's a classification that properly maintained systems are reliable (classification(F,G)), then the conclusion is the computer system is reliable (be(A,G)).

But the user's example has the conclusion as be(A,G). So perhaps the given text is the conclusion, and the missing premises are the classification and the instance. But the user's text is written as "the computer system is properly maintained," which would be be(computer_system, properly_maintained). So for that to be the conclusion, the premises would need to be classification(some_class, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, some_class). For example, if some_class is "regularly maintained systems," then the premises would be classification(regularly_maintained_systems, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_systems). 

But the user's text only provides "the computer system is properly maintained," which is the conclusion. The enthymeme is missing the premises. Therefore, the user's text is the conclusion, and the missing premises are the classification premise and the instance premise.

However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where the conclusion or premises might be missing. So perhaps the given text is a premise, and the conclusion is missing. Or maybe the given text is part of the premises. Wait, but the example provided in the context for the Classification scheme has two premises and a conclusion.

In the user's case, the text is "In this case, the computer system is properly maintained." If this is the entire argument, then perhaps the argument is missing the general classification premise. For example, the full argument would be:

All computer systems that receive regular updates are properly maintained. The computer system receives regular updates. Therefore, the computer system is properly maintained.

In this case, the given text is the conclusion, and the premises are missing. But the user's text is presented as the entire argument, which is an enthymeme. So the user's text is either a premise or the conclusion. But the user hasn't provided the other parts.

Wait, perhaps the given text is part of the premises. Let me recheck the user's instruction. The user says: "You must translate the given argument to a computational form... The text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples."

The text provided is: "In this case, the computer system is properly maintained." So the user's input is just that sentence. It's an enthymeme, so parts are missing. The task is to figure out which argumentation scheme it fits and instantiate the variables and predicates.

Looking at the schemes again. For example, the Classification scheme requires two premises: classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The conclusion is be(A,G). So if the given text is one of these, which one?

Suppose the given text is "the computer system is properly maintained" as the conclusion. Then the missing premises would be classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). For example, F could be "regularly_updated_systems." So the premises would be classification(regularly_updated_systems, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, regularly_updated_systems). Then the conclusion is be(computer_system, properly_maintained). But the user's text only provides the conclusion. Alternatively, maybe the given text is a premise. For example, if the given premise is be(computer_system, properly_maintained), then the conclusion would be something else, but that doesn't fit the Classification scheme's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the given text is part of another scheme. Let's check other schemes.

Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is about pursuing a goal and a necessary condition for it.

Position to Know: [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], Ar. The example involves someone in a position to know asserting something.

Double Standard: [adopt(X, opinion...), etc.], which involves applying different standards.

Vagueness: [has_property(Y,F), vague_for(F,PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y). The example is about a report with vague properties in a context requiring clarity.

Effect to Cause: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). For example, if A happens and A is followed by B, then B occurs.

But the given text is "the computer system is properly maintained." It's a statement about a property. How does that fit? Let's think. If it's part of the Classification scheme, maybe the premises are classification(properly_maintained_system, reliable_system) and be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system), leading to be(computer_system, reliable_system). But the given text is only one part.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's argument is that because the computer system is properly maintained (classified as such), then it should be considered reliable. But the user's text is only the premise, and the conclusion is missing. However, the example provided for Classification in the context requires two premises and a conclusion. So if the user's text is one premise, the other premise and conclusion are missing.

But the user's instruction says to instantiate all variables and predicates given the natural language enthymeme. The answer must be in the format "Final answer: <computational argument>".

Wait, maybe the given text is the conclusion, and the premises are missing. For example, the full argument would be:

All systems that receive regular maintenance are properly maintained. The computer system receives regular maintenance. Therefore, the computer system is properly maintained.

In the Classification scheme, this would be:

[classification(system_receiving_regular_maintenance, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, system_receiving_regular_maintenance)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But the user's text is "the computer system is properly maintained," which is the conclusion. Therefore, the premises would be the classification and the be statement. But since the user's text is only the conclusion, the enthymeme is missing the premises. However, the task is to infer the missing components based on the given text. Wait, but how can we know the missing premises? Unless the text is part of the premises.

Alternatively, maybe the given text is part of the premises, and the conclusion is missing. For example, if the premise is classification(computer_system, properly_maintained), and another premise is be(computer_system, F), then the conclusion is be(computer_system, G). But without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that since the computer system is properly maintained (be(A,F)), and classification(F,G) exists, then the conclusion is be(A,G). But to fill in the variables, we need to know F and G.

But the user's text only gives "the computer system is properly maintained," which is be(computer_system, properly_maintained). If this is the conclusion, then the premises would need to be classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). But since the user's text is the conclusion, we need to infer F and G. For example, F could be 'regularly_maintained_system' and G 'properly_maintained_system'.

But without more information, it's challenging. However, maybe the user's text is the second premise (be(A,F)), and the first premise is classification(F,G), leading to the conclusion be(A,G). But the user hasn't provided the first premise.

Given that the user's text is a single statement, perhaps it's part of the Classification scheme as the second premise. For example, if the first premise is classification(eagle, bird), and the second is be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to the conclusion be(white_eagle, bird). So in the user's case, if the given text is the second premise (be(A,F)), then the first premise would be classification(F, G), and the conclusion is be(A, G). But the user hasn't provided the first premise or the conclusion.

However, the task is to infer the missing components. So maybe the given text is the conclusion, and we need to infer the premises. But how? Without additional context, it's difficult.

Wait, looking back at the example in the Classification scheme:

Example 1: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. The computational form is [classification(eagle,bird), be(white_eagle,eagle)], be(white_eagle,bird).

The given text is "the computer system is properly maintained." So if this is analogous to the conclusion "white eagles are birds," then the premises would be classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). For example, F could be 'a system_under_maintenance'.

But since the user's text is the conclusion, the premises are missing. But how to infer F and G?

Alternatively, maybe the given text is one of the premises, and the other premise and conclusion are missing. But the task is to instantiate all variables and predicates given the natural language enthymeme. The user's text is the enthymeme, so perhaps it's part of the premises.

Wait, the user's text is: "In this case, the computer system is properly maintained." This could be the second premise in the Classification scheme, which is be(A,F). The first premise would be classification(F,G), and the conclusion is be(A,G). But to fill this in, we need to know F and G.

But how can we infer F and G from the given text? Maybe the user's example is similar. For example, if the computer system is part of a class that is classified as properly maintained. For instance, if F is 'systems_with_regular_updates' and G is 'properly_maintained_systems', then the premises would be classification(systems_with_regular_updates, properly_maintained_systems) and be(computer_system, systems_with_regular_updates), leading to be(computer_system, properly_maintained_systems). The conclusion is the user's text.

But the user's text is already the conclusion. So the premises are missing. But the task is to translate the given argument into computational form, inferring the missing components.

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is part of the premises. For example, if the argument is:

All properly maintained systems are reliable. The computer system is properly maintained. Therefore, the computer system is reliable.

In this case, the premises would be classification(properly_maintained_system, reliable_system) and be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system), leading to be(computer_system, reliable_system). Here, the given text is the second premise. But how do we know the first premise and conclusion?

The problem states that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing. Therefore, the given text is part of the argument, and the rest needs to be inferred.

But without more context, perhaps the user's argument is that since the computer system is classified as properly maintained (be(A,F)), and there's a general classification (classification(F,G)), the conclusion is be(A,G). The variables would be:

A = computer_system

F = properly_maintained_system (but this seems redundant)

Wait, perhaps F is a subclass. For example, F could be 'regularly_maintained_system', and G is 'properly_maintained_system'. Then:

classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained_system)

be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)

Conclusion: be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system)

But the given text is the conclusion. So the premises would be the two above. But the user's text is the conclusion, so the premises are missing. But how can we know F and G? Maybe F is a more specific class. Alternatively, maybe the classification is from a broader category. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is using the premise that the computer system is part of a class (e.g., maintained_systems), and that class is classified as properly maintained. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, looking at the example in the Classification scheme, the structure is:

[classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G)

So the first premise is classification(F,G), second is be(A,F), conclusion is be(A,G).

If the given text is the conclusion, then the premises are classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). But what is F here?

In the example, F is 'eagle', G is 'bird', and A is 'white_eagle'. So F is a more specific category than G.

In the user's case, if the conclusion is be(computer_system, properly_maintained), then G is 'properly_maintained'. So F must be a subclass of properly_maintained. For example, F could be 'systems_with_regular_maintenance', which are classified as properly_maintained. Then the premises would be:

classification(systems_with_regular_maintenance, properly_maintained)

be(computer_system, systems_with_regular_maintenance)

Conclusion: be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But the user's text is the conclusion. So the enthymeme is missing the two premises. But the task is to infer the missing components based on the given text. Since the user only provides the conclusion, perhaps the premises are to be inferred, but how? Without additional context, it's impossible to know F and G.

Alternatively, perhaps the given text is the second premise (be(A,F)), and the first premise and conclusion are missing. For example, if the argument is:

All computer systems in the server room are properly maintained. The computer system is in the server room. Therefore, it is properly maintained.

Here, classification(computer_system_in_server_room, properly_maintained), and be(computer_system, computer_system_in_server_room). Conclusion: be(computer_system, properly_maintained). But the user's text is the second premise (be(A,F)), so the first premise and conclusion are missing. However, the user's text is the entire argument, which is an enthymeme. Therefore, the user's text is the conclusion, and the premises are missing.

But given that, how can we know F and G? The task requires to instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. Since the user's text is the conclusion, we need to infer F and G such that classification(F,G) and be(A,F) are the premises. But without more info, perhaps F and G are general terms. 

Wait, but the example uses specific terms like 'eagle' and 'bird'. In the user's case, perhaps the classification is that a 'properly_maintained_system' is a 'reliable_system', and the computer system is a 'properly_maintained_system', leading to it being a 'reliable_system'. But the given text is "properly maintained", not 'reliable'. So this doesn't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is that since the computer system is a member of a class (e.g., 'systems_with_updates'), and that class is classified as 'properly_maintained', hence the computer system is properly maintained. But again, without knowing the specific class, it's hard to define.

Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, but no. The task is to fit the given text into one of the schemes. Given that the Classification scheme requires two premises and a conclusion, and the user's text is a single statement, which is the conclusion, the missing premises must be inferred. However, without additional information, I can only hypothesize. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is the second premise (be(A,F)), and the first premise is classification(F,G), leading to the conclusion be(A,G). But since the user's text is the entire argument, perhaps it's part of the premises, and the conclusion is missing. But without knowing G, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the user's text is part of the Position to Know scheme. For example, if someone in a position to know asserts that the computer system is properly maintained. But the text doesn't mention any authority.

Alternatively, the text could be part of the Necessary Condition scheme. For example, if the goal is to have a functional system, and the necessary condition is proper maintenance. But the text only states that the computer system is properly maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps the text is a premise in the Effect to Cause scheme. For example, if proper maintenance occurred, and proper maintenance is followed by some effect. But the text doesn't mention an effect.

Given all this, I think the most plausible scheme is the Classification scheme. The given text is the conclusion, and the premises are inferred. Therefore, the variables would be:

classification(F, G) and be(computer_system, F) leading to be(computer_system, G). But the user's text is be(computer_system, properly_maintained), so G is properly_maintained. Then F is a subclass of G. For example, F could be 'regularly_maintained_system', and G is 'properly_maintained_system'. 

Thus, the premises would be classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained_system) and be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system), leading to be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system). But the user's text is the conclusion. So the computational form would be:

[classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained_system), be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system)

But how do I know F and G? Since the user's text only provides the conclusion, I need to infer F and G. However, without additional context, perhaps F is 'computer_system' and G is 'properly_maintained'. Wait, that would make the first premise classification(computer_system, properly_maintained), and the second premise be(computer_system, computer_system), which is trivial. But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is missing the general premise. For example:

All computer systems in this company are properly maintained. The computer system in question is one of them. Therefore, it is properly maintained.

But again, the computational form would be [classification(company_computer_systems, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, company_computer_systems)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained). But without knowing the general premise, it's hard to fill in.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user's text is part of the Classification scheme, and the missing components are the general classification and the specific instance. However, since the user's text is the conclusion, I have to infer the premises. But without more information, I can only use placeholders. However, the task requires to instantiate all variables and predicates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given text is a premise, and the conclusion is missing. For example, if the premise is that the computer system is classified as properly maintained, and there's a classification that properly maintained systems are reliable, then the conclusion is that the computer system is reliable. But again, without info on the other premise, this is speculative.

But the user's instruction says to "inferring the missing components". So maybe the given text is one premise, and the other premise and conclusion are inferred. But how?

Wait, looking back at the example for the Classification scheme:

Example 1: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds.

The computational form is [classification(eagle,bird), be(white_eagle,eagle)], be(white_eagle,bird).

In the user's case, if the given text is analogous to "White eagles are eagles", then the user's text is the second premise (be(A,F)), and the first premise is classification(F,G), leading to be(A,G). So if the user's text is "the computer system is properly maintained", but that would be the conclusion. Wait, no. In the example, "White eagles are eagles" is the second premise. The conclusion is "White eagles are birds".

So if the user's text is "the computer system is properly maintained", which is be(computer_system, properly_maintained), then this would be the conclusion. Therefore, the premises must be classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). For example:

Premise 1: classification(regularly_maintained_systems, properly_maintained)

Premise 2: be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_systems)

Conclusion: be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But how to determine F and G? Since the user's text is the conclusion, G is properly_maintained, and F is a subclass. But the user's text doesn't provide F, so we have to infer it. However, without additional information, perhaps F is the same as A. For instance, if F is 'computer_system', but that would make the classification premise classification(computer_system, properly_maintained), and the be premise be(computer_system, computer_system), which is trivial. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the argument structure, but the answer must be based on the given context. 

Alternatively, maybe the given text is part of a different scheme. For example, the Position to Know scheme. If someone in a position to know about computer systems asserts that it's properly maintained, then we can conclude it is. But the user's text doesn't mention any authority.

Alternatively, the Necessary Condition scheme. If the goal is to have a functioning system, and proper maintenance is a necessary condition. But the user's text doesn't mention a goal.

After considering all options, the most plausible scheme is the Classification scheme, where the given text is the conclusion, and the missing premises are the classification and the be premise. To instantiate, perhaps:

classification(computer_system, properly_maintained_system), be(computer_system, computer_system), leading to be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system). But this seems redundant. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is that since the computer system is a type of system that is classified as properly maintained, then it is. But this is circular.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is missing the general premise and the specific premise. For example:

All systems under warranty are properly maintained. The computer system is under warranty. Therefore, it is properly maintained.

This would fit the Classification scheme with:

[classification(systems_under_warranty, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, systems_under_warranty)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But the user's text is the conclusion. So the premises are missing. The task is to infer them. However, the user's text is the only information given. Therefore, perhaps the variables are:

classification(F, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, F)

But without knowing F, it's impossible to instantiate. Therefore, maybe F is a general term like 'maintained_system', leading to:

[classification(maintained_system, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But this is speculative. However, given the user's example, the answer must be in the exact format. The user's text is the conclusion, so the computational form must include the premises and the conclusion. But since the user's text is the conclusion, and the premises are missing, we have to infer them. The only way is to assume that the general classification is that a certain class is properly maintained, and the computer system is in that class.

But how to name F and G? Let's assume that F is 'maintained_system', G is 'properly_maintained_system'. Then:

[classification(maintained_system, properly_maintained_system), be(computer_system, maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system)

But the user's text is "the computer system is properly maintained." So the conclusion is be(computer_system, properly_maintained). So perhaps G is 'properly_maintained', and F is 'maintained_system'.

Alternatively, maybe 'properly_maintained' is the class G, and F is 'computer_system'. But that would make the classification premise classification(computer_system, properly_maintained), and the be premise be(computer_system, computer_system), leading to be(computer_system, properly_maintained). But this is trivial and doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is missing the general premise, like "All properly maintained systems are reliable," but that would be a different scheme. 

After struggling, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the given text is the conclusion of the Classification scheme. Therefore, the premises must be classification(F, properly_maintained) and be(computer_system, F). Since the user's example uses 'eagle' and 'bird', which are nouns, perhaps F is a noun. So let's choose F as 'regularly_maintained_system'. Thus:

classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained)

be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)

Conclusion: be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained), be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained)

But the user's text uses "properly maintained" as an adjective, but in the example, it's using nouns. However, the predicates in the example are be(white_eagle, eagle), where 'eagle' is a noun. So perhaps 'properly_maintained' should be a noun phrase. Maybe 'properly_maintained_system'.

Thus, the computational form would be:

[classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained_system), be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system)

But the user's text is "properly maintained", which in the computational form would be 'properly_maintained_system'. So the conclusion is be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system). 

Therefore, the final answer should be:

[classification(regularly_maintained_system, properly_maintained_system), be(computer_system, regularly_maintained_system)], be(computer_system, properly_maintained_system)

But since the user's text is the conclusion, and we need to infer the missing premises, this is the correct form. However, without more context, this is an assumption, but based on the example provided, this is the best approach.


Okay, let's break this down. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme. The text given is: "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused."

First, I need to figure out which argumentation scheme this fits into. The context includes several schemes like Analogy, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, etc. Let's look at the examples provided.

The Effect to Cause example states that if a company provides excellent service, satisfaction increases. The structure here is [occured(A), followed(A, B)], so B occurs. The premise is that A happened and A leads to B, therefore B happens.

In the given text, the structure is similar: If someone gets enough sleep (A), then they will feel more focused (B). The general form here seems to be that the occurrence of A leads to B. So if A occurs, then B follows. The conclusion would be that if a person gets enough sleep (A occurred), then they will feel focused (B occurs). 

Wait, but the example in the Effect to Cause scheme uses 'occured' and 'followed'. The structure is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], which leads to occurs(B). In the example, the company provides service (A), which is followed by increased satisfaction (B). The argument is that since A occurred and A is followed by B, then B occurs.

The given text is a general statement: "if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." So maybe the actual argument is missing a premise where a person does get enough sleep, and then the conclusion is they feel focused. But the text as given is only stating the general rule, not the specific instance. Wait, but the user mentioned it's an enthymeme, which could be missing a premise or conclusion. 

Looking again, the text says "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." That's the general rule. But in the Effect to Cause example, the premises are the occurrence of A and that A is followed by B. The conclusion is B occurs. So perhaps the enthymeme here is missing the specific instance where a person gets enough sleep, leading to the conclusion they'll feel focused. But the text provided is only the general statement. Hmm, maybe the user is presenting the argument as the general rule, and the actual application would be an instance where someone gets sleep, hence the conclusion. But the text as given is the general premise. Wait, maybe the user's example is incomplete. Let me check the Effect to Cause example again. In the example, the premises are: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], and the conclusion is increases(company,customer_satisfaction). The structure is that A occurred, and A is followed by B, so B occurs.

The given text "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." This is the general rule, which would correspond to the 'followed' part. But to form the argument, we need an occurrence of A (someone getting enough sleep) and the followed by B (feeling focused). So if the argument is presented as: "A person got enough sleep. Therefore, they will feel more focused," then the premises would be the occurrence of getting sleep and the followed by relationship. However, the text provided is just the general statement. Wait, perhaps the user's example is different. Wait, in the Effect to Cause example, the first premise is the general rule: "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase." Then the second premise is "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." Therefore, the conclusion is "customer satisfaction will increase."

So the given text "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." is the general rule (the 'followed' part). If the enthymeme is missing the specific occurrence, like "John got enough sleep. Therefore, John will feel more focused," then the premises would be occured(sleep) and followed(sleep, focused). But in the text provided, only the general statement is given. However, since it's an enthymeme, maybe the conclusion is missing. But the user's instruction says that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing. So the given text is part of the argument. Wait, the user says "You must translate the given argument to a computational form... by inferring the missing components." So the text provided is the enthymeme, which might be missing parts. 

Wait, the text given is: "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." That's a conditional statement. In the Effect to Cause example, the structure includes a general rule and a specific occurrence. The example has two premises: the general rule (if A then B) and the occurrence of A. The conclusion is B. So the given text is the general rule (the 'followed' part), but the enthymeme might be missing the premise that the person did get enough sleep. Therefore, the full argument would be:

Premise 1: Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused. (followed(occured(get_sleep), occurs(feel_focused))
Premise 2: The person got enough sleep. (occured(get_sleep))
Conclusion: Therefore, they will feel more focused. (occurs(feel_focused))

But in the user's text, only the first premise is given. So the enthymeme is missing the second premise and the conclusion. However, the user's instruction says that the argument is an enthymeme where conclusion or premises might be missing. So the computational form should represent the argument as per the scheme, filling in the missing parts. But how?

Wait, the Effect to Cause scheme's computational form is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So the two premises are occured(A) and followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), and the conclusion is occurs(B).

In the given text, the user provides "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." That corresponds to the 'followed' part. But the premise 'occured(A)' is missing. However, since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the argument is presented as: Because generally if A then B, therefore B. But that's not valid. No, the argument needs both premises. So maybe the user's text is missing the occurrence of A. For example, the full argument would be: "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused. John got enough sleep. Therefore, John feels more focused." But the given text only has the first part. But the user says to infer the missing components. Wait, maybe the text provided is the entire argument, but it's missing the conclusion. Wait, no. The text is "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." That's just the general rule, which in the example is part of the 'followed' premise. The example's computational form for Effect to Cause is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So in the example, the first premise is the occurrence of providing service, and the second is the followed by relationship. The general statement "if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase" is part of the 'followed' premise. So the given text here is the 'followed' part. But to form the argument, we need the occurrence of A. However, the text provided only has the general rule, not the specific occurrence. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the premise that A occurred. But how can we instantiate the variables? Maybe the user expects us to infer that the argument is structured with the general rule as one premise, and the occurrence as another, leading to the conclusion. But the text provided is only the general rule, so the missing parts are the occurrence and conclusion. However, the user's instruction says to infer the missing components. Wait, perhaps the text is presented as the entire argument, but as an enthymeme. For example, maybe the conclusion is missing. But in the example, the premises are the occurrence and the followed by, leading to the conclusion. If the given text is the 'followed by' part, but the occurrence is missing, then perhaps the argument is incomplete. But how to represent that? The user says to instantiate all variables and predicates. Let's try. The scheme is Effect to Cause: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The given text is the 'followed' part. So we need to have A and B. Let's parse the text: "if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." Here, A is 'a person gets enough sleep' and B is 'they will feel more focused'. In the computational form, 'occured(A)' would be the instance where A happens. But the text only provides the 'followed' relationship. However, in the example, the 'followed' is between the occurrence of A and B. So perhaps the 'followed' predicate is followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), where A is the event of providing service, and B is the effect. In the given text, A is 'a person gets enough sleep' (so event: get_enough_sleep(Person)), and B is 'feel more focused' (feel_more_focused(Person)). But variables need to be instantiated. The variables in the scheme are A and B. So in the example, the variables are instantiated as provides(company,excellent_customer_service) and increases(company,customer_satisfaction). 

So translating the given text into the scheme, the 'followed' premise would be followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person))). But since the argument is an enthymeme missing the occurrence premise, maybe the user expects us to represent the general rule as part of the 'followed' premise and assume that the occurrence is present in the argument. Wait, but the text is "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." This is a general statement, which in the example corresponds to the 'followed' premise. However, in the example, the followed premise is written as followed(occured(provides(...)), ...). So the followed predicate is between the occurrence of A and the occurrence of B. The general statement "if A then B" is captured in the 'followed' predicate. So in the given text, the 'followed' part is followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person))). But the argument as given is only the 'followed' premise. To form a complete argument, we need the occurrence of A. Since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the missing premise is that a person did get enough sleep, leading to the conclusion they feel focused. So the full computational form would be:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))], occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But the text only provides the 'followed' part. However, the user says to infer the missing components. Wait, perhaps the enthymeme is presented as the general rule (the 'followed' premise) and the conclusion, but missing the occurrence. Or perhaps the other way around. But the user's instruction says that the text is the enthymeme where parts are missing. The text provided is only the general statement. So maybe the actual argument is: "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused. Therefore, John, who got enough sleep, will feel more focused." But in the text, only the general premise is given. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is the entire argument, but it's missing the conclusion. For example, if someone says "If A, then B. Therefore, B." But that's not valid. Alternatively, maybe the text is the premise, and the conclusion is missing. But the user says to translate the given argument into the computational form, inferring missing parts. Let's look back at the example in the Effect to Cause scheme. The example in natural language is: "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." The computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). So the two premises are the occurrence of A and the followed by relation. The text provided here only has the "Generally, if..." part, which is the 'followed' premise. So the enthymeme is missing the occurrence premise and the conclusion. But the user's instruction says to infer the missing components. Therefore, to instantiate the variables, we need to have A and B. In the given text, A is "a person gets enough sleep" and B is "they will feel more focused". So, in the computational form:

A = get_enough_sleep(P) where P is a person. But in the scheme, variables are instantiated with specific terms. Wait, in the example, the company is a specific entity. But in the given text, it's a general statement. However, the scheme requires the occurrence of A. So perhaps the argument is about a specific person. For example, if the text were "John got enough sleep. Therefore, he will feel more focused," then the premises would be occured(get_enough_sleep(john)) and followed(...). But the given text is general. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the user's example is a general rule applied to a specific case. But the text provided is only the general rule. Therefore, the user might expect that the missing parts are the specific occurrence and the conclusion. However, since the text is only the general statement, perhaps the computational form should represent the general rule as the 'followed' premise, and the missing parts are left as variables. But the instruction says to instantiate all variables and predicates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of a larger argument where the specific case is implied. For example, the text is presented as a premise in an argument where the occurrence is assumed. But without more information, I need to infer based on the given text. 

Given that the text is "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." And the argumentation scheme is Effect to Cause, which requires two premises: the occurrence of A and the followed by relation. Therefore, the computational form would be missing the occurrence premise. However, the user says to infer the missing components. Maybe the argument is presented with only the general premise, and the conclusion is missing. But without the occurrence, the conclusion can't be drawn. Therefore, perhaps the user's text is incomplete, and we need to represent what's given. But according to the example, the 'followed' premise is part of the premises. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is the entire argument, and the conclusion is the general statement. But that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe the user's text is the entire argument as an enthymeme, which is missing a premise or the conclusion. For example, the full argument would be:

Premise 1: Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused. (followed)
Premise 2: John got enough sleep. (occured)
Conclusion: Therefore, John will feel more focused.

But the text provided is only Premise 1. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing Premise 2 and the conclusion. But the user says to infer the missing components. However, without knowing the specific instance (like John), we can't fill in those variables. Therefore, maybe the variables are left as general terms. But the example uses specific instances (company, john, etc.). 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is being made in general terms, not about a specific case. But the Effect to Cause scheme in the example is about a specific case. Therefore, this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text belongs to a different scheme. Let's check the other schemes. 

The Necessary Condition scheme is about goals and necessary conditions. Doesn't fit. 

The Moral Justification Ad Populum involves everybody who is Y accepts P, and X's goal is Y. Not relevant here. 

The Position to Know requires someone in a position to know. Not applicable. 

Vagueness of Verbal Classification involves vague properties. Doesn't fit. 

The Argument from Opposites: Fire and ice. Not applicable. 

Classification scheme: like eagles being birds. The given text is a conditional, not a classification. 

Double Standard: applying different standards. Not here. 

Need for Help: would help, can carry out, not too costly. Doesn't fit. 

Analogy based on Classification: comparing features. No. 

So it's either Effect to Cause or another. Since the text is a conditional statement about cause and effect, Effect to Cause is the right scheme. 

Therefore, the computational form should have the 'followed' premise, and the missing occurrence premise and conclusion. But how to represent that. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

So even though the text only provides the general 'followed' premise, we need to infer the missing components (premises or conclusion) and instantiate all variables. 

In the example, the variables in the Effect to Cause scheme are A and B. In the user's text, A is "a person gets enough sleep" and B is "they will feel more focused". But we need to represent these as specific instances. However, the example uses specific terms like 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)'. 

Perhaps the general statement is represented with variables. But the schemes use specific instances. For example, in the example, the company is a specific entity. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is about a generic person. For example, if the text is "A person got enough sleep. Therefore, they feel more focused," but the given text is the general rule. 

Alternatively, the argument is structured as:

Premise 1: Generally, if A occurs (person gets sleep), then B occurs (feel focused). 
Premise 2: A occurs (person got sleep).
Conclusion: B occurs (feel focused).

But the text provided is Premise 1. So the enthymeme is missing Premise 2 and the conclusion. But to instantiate the variables, we need to have specific terms. However, the text uses a general "a person". 

In the example, the company is a specific instance. But here, we might have a general term. Maybe we can represent 'person' as a variable, but in the computational form, variables are typically instantiated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is a general rule, and the argument is that whenever A occurs, B follows. But the Effect to Cause scheme requires a specific occurrence. 

This is a bit confusing. Let's look at the example again. The Effect to Cause example's computational form is:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the 'followed' predicate links the occurrence of A to the occurrence of B. 

In the user's text, the general statement is "if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused." This corresponds to the 'followed' premise: followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(P)), occurs(feel_more_focused(P))).

But to complete the argument, we need an occurrence of get_enough_sleep(P) for some P. However, the text doesn't provide a specific instance. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the occurrence premise and the conclusion. But since the user says to infer the missing components, perhaps we can assume a generic person. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is being made in general terms, such as "For all persons, if they get enough sleep, they feel focused," but the scheme requires specific instances. 

Wait, maybe the argument is structured as a universally quantified statement, but the computational form uses specific instances. In the example, the company is a specific entity. 

Perhaps the user's text is part of a larger argument where the specific person is implied. Without that, we can't instantiate the variables. 

But the user says to "infer the missing components". So perhaps the argument is presented as:

Premise: Generally, if a person gets enough sleep (A), then they feel focused (B). 
Unstated premise: Person X got enough sleep.
Conclusion: Therefore, X feels focused.

But since X is not mentioned, we can't know. However, the user says to infer the missing components. So maybe we can represent the argument with variables, but the computational form requires specific terms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the variables can be general. For example, 'person' is the subject. 

But looking at the example, the company is a specific term (not a variable). Therefore, maybe in this case, the person is a specific individual. But the text doesn't mention a specific person. 

This is tricky. Let's proceed by assuming that the argument is about a generic person, and represent the variables accordingly. 

In the computational form, the 'followed' premise would be followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person))). Then, the occurrence premise would be occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), leading to the conclusion occurs(feel_more_focused(person)). 

But the text only provides the 'followed' premise. Therefore, the computational form should include both premises and the conclusion, but the user's text is missing the occurrence and conclusion. However, the instruction says to infer the missing components. So we need to include them. 

But how? For example, if the text were "John got enough sleep. Therefore, he feels focused," then the premises are occurrence and followed, leading to the conclusion. But the user's text is missing those. 

Alternatively, perhaps the argument is presented as the general rule, and the conclusion is that whenever someone gets sleep, they feel focused. But that's the same as the premise. 

I think there's confusion here. Maybe the text is the entire argument, which is just the general statement. But that doesn't fit the scheme. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is an example of the Effect to Cause scheme, but missing the specific instance. Therefore, we need to represent it with placeholders. 

But the user's instruction says to "instantiate ALL the variables and predicates". Therefore, we need specific terms. 

Wait, maybe the text is part of an argument where the speaker is stating the general rule, and the implicit premise is that the listener (or someone) did get enough sleep, hence the conclusion. But without knowing who, we can't instantiate. 

Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check the example again. 

In the Effect to Cause example, the premises are:

1. Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. 

2. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. 

Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase. 

The computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the 'followed' premise is the general rule, and the 'occured' premise is the specific instance. 

In the user's text, the given text is only the general rule (the 'followed' premise). Therefore, the missing parts are the 'occured' premise and the conclusion. But since the text doesn't provide a specific instance, perhaps we need to represent it with a placeholder variable. However, the example uses specific terms. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is the entire argument, which is missing parts. For example, the argument is: "Generally, if a person gets enough sleep, then they will feel more focused. Therefore, if you want to feel focused, get enough sleep." But that's not fitting the scheme. 

Alternatively, the argument is: "Generally, if A then B. Therefore, A implies B." But that's tautological. 

I think the correct approach is to recognize that the given text is the 'followed' premise of the Effect to Cause scheme, and the missing components are the occurrence of A and the conclusion B. Since the text is an enthymeme, we need to infer that the speaker is implying that someone (let's say Person) did get enough sleep, hence the conclusion. 

But how to represent that in the computational form. Let's assume a specific instance. For example, let's take a generic person 'person'. 

So:

- A = get_enough_sleep(person)
- B = feel_more_focused(person)

Premises:

1. occured(get_enough_sleep(person))
2. followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))

Conclusion: occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But the text only provides premise 2. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing premise 1 and the conclusion. But the user says to infer the missing components. Therefore, we need to include them in the computational form. 

So the computational form would be:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))], occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But the user's text only mentions the general rule (premise 2). So perhaps the user expects us to include the occurrence premise and conclusion, even though they're not in the text. But that's the nature of an enthymeme: parts are missing and must be inferred. 

Therefore, the final answer should be:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))], occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But in the example, the 'followed' predicate is written as followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), which is exactly what we have here. 

However, variables like 'person' might need to be specific. But since the text uses a general 'a person', maybe we can leave it as a general term. Alternatively, use a placeholder like 'X'. 

Wait, in the example, the company is a specific entity (not a variable). So perhaps we need to use a specific term here. But the text doesn't provide one. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to have a specific example, but the text is general. 

This is a bit of a problem. However, given the user's instruction to infer the missing components, and the need to instantiate variables, perhaps we can assume a specific person, say 'john', even though it's not in the text. 

But that's adding information not present. Alternatively, represent 'person' as a general class. 

Alternatively, the variables in the scheme are events. For example, 'get_enough_sleep' is the event, and the subject is 'person'. 

But in the example, the event is 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)'. So the predicate is applied to the company. 

In this case, 'get_enough_sleep' would be an event involving a person. So perhaps the correct instantiation is:

A = get_enough_sleep(person)
B = feel_more_focused(person)

Therefore, the computational form is:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))], occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But the user's text doesn't mention 'person' getting sleep; it's a general 'a person'. But the example uses a specific company. This discrepancy suggests that maybe the person should be a specific individual. But since the text doesn't provide one, I'll proceed with 'person' as the subject, even though it's generic. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final answer: [occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),occurs(feel_more_focused(person))],occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

Wait, but in the example, the followed predicate is written as 'followed(occured(A), occurs(B))'. Let me check the example again. In the example, the 'followed' is followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction)). So the structure is followed(occured(event), effect). 

In our case, the event is 'get_enough_sleep(person)', and the effect is 'feel_more_focused(person)'. 

Therefore, the correct computational form would be:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person))], occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But we need to check the syntax. In the example, 'provides(company,excellent_customer_service)' is the event, and 'increases(company,customer_satisfaction)' is the effect. 

Similarly, 'get_enough_sleep(person)' is the event, and 'feel_more_focused(person)' is the effect. 

So the predicates should be structured similarly. Therefore, the correct instantiation is:

occured(get_enough_sleep(person))

followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)), occurs(feel_more_focused(person)))

Conclusion: occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

Therefore, the final answer should be:

[occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),occurs(feel_more_focused(person))],occurs(feel_more_focused(person))

But wait, the example has 'occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service))' and 'followed(occured(provides(...)), increases(...))'. 

Yes. So the structure matches. 

But in the user's text, the 'person' is a general term. However, in the computational form, we need to represent it as a specific term. But the text uses a general 'a person', so maybe 'person' is treated as a class. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a variable, but the example uses specific terms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a specific instance like 'someone' or 'individual', but the example uses 'company' which is a specific entity. 

Given that, perhaps 'person' is acceptable as a specific term in this context. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final answer: [occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),followed(occured(get_enough_sleep(person)),occurs(feel_more_focused(person))],occurs(feel_more_focused(person))


Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided an argument in natural language, which is an enthymeme, meaning either the conclusion or some premises might be missing. My task is to translate this argument into a computational form based on the given context of argumentation schemes.

First, I need to recall the different argumentation schemes provided in the context. The example given here is the text: "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." The user mentioned that the text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided. Let me look through each scheme to see which one fits.

Looking at the Effect to Cause scheme: The example there starts with a general statement, then a specific occurrence, leading to a conclusion. The structure is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example given in the context is about a company providing excellent service leading to increased customer satisfaction. The premises are that the company provides the service (occured(A)), and if A occurs, B follows. The conclusion is that B occurs.

Now, the text provided is "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." That seems like the specific occurrence (occured(A)). The original example's full argument includes the general premise (if A then B) and the specific occurrence (A), leading to the conclusion (B). But in the given text, only the specific occurrence is mentioned. However, since it's an enthymeme, the other premise (the general rule) and the conclusion might be missing.

Wait, the user's instruction says that the text is an enthymeme where parts might be missing. So I need to see if the provided text is part of one of the schemes. The Effect to Cause example uses two premises: the occurrence of A and the followed by relation between A and B. The given text only states "the company provides excellent customer service" which is the occurrence of A. But the other premise (the general rule that A leads to B) is missing, as well as the conclusion that B occurs. However, in the computational representation, the scheme is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So for the given text, maybe the user expects me to infer the missing components based on the example provided in the context.

Looking back at the example in the Effect to Cause scheme: The natural language example states the general rule first, then the specific occurrence. The computational representation is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(...)), increases(...))], increases(...). So in the given text, "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." This is the occured(A) part. The missing parts would be the followed(A, B) premise and the conclusion B.

But the user says that the text is an enthymeme, so maybe the conclusion is missing. The original example's conclusion is "Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." So if the given text is the premise, then the conclusion would be "customer satisfaction will increase," and the other premise is the general rule "if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase."

Therefore, translating the given text into the Effect to Cause scheme would require the two premises: occured(A) and followed(A, B), leading to occurs(B). The given text is occured(A), so the missing premise is followed(A, B), and the conclusion is occurs(B).

But how to represent this computationally? The example's computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). Wait, the first premise in the example is written as occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), and the second is followed(occured(...), increases(...)). Then the conclusion is increases(...). But in the computational representation, the two premises are occured(A) and followed(A, B), which are separate. Wait, in the example's code, it's written as [occured(provides(...), followed(...)], ... So the two premises are occured(A) and followed(A, B). Therefore, given the text, which is "the company provides excellent customer service," that's occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service)). Then the other premise would be followed(occured(provides(...)), increases(...)), and the conclusion is increases(...).

But the user hasn't provided the conclusion or the other premise. However, since the text is part of the enthymeme, we need to infer the missing parts based on the example. Since the example's conclusion is "customer satisfaction will increase," and the scheme requires the two premises, the user's text must be the first premise. But to fully instantiate the variables and predicates, we need to map the given text to the scheme.

So the variables here are A and B. A is the action of providing excellent customer service. B is the effect of customer satisfaction increasing.

So the given text is occured(A), which is occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service)).

The missing premise is followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), which would be followed(occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service)), increases(company, customer_satisfaction)).

The conclusion then is occurs(B), which is increases(company, customer_satisfaction).

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

But in the example provided in the context, the code is written as:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

Wait, looking back at the example's computational representation:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the second argument in the list is followed(occured(A), B). So in the example, the followed predicate has two arguments: the first is the occurrence of A, and the second is the occurrence of B.

Therefore, in the given text, the premises would be:

1. occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service))

2. followed(occured(provides(company, excellent_customer_service)), increases(company, customer_satisfaction))

Conclusion: increases(company, customer_satisfaction)

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

This matches the structure of the Effect to Cause argumentation scheme. The original text is the first premise, and the missing parts are the second premise (the general rule) and the conclusion. Since the user's instruction says to instantiate all variables and predicates by inferring the missing components, I need to include all premises and conclusion even if they are not explicitly stated in the text. But wait, the text provided is only the first premise. However, in the example, the natural language example includes both the general rule and the specific case. But in the given text here, only the specific case is provided. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so the other premise and conclusion are missing. But in the computational representation, we need to include all premises and the conclusion as per the scheme.

Therefore, the answer should be the same as the example's computational form, except maybe the variables. Wait, no. The example's first premise is the general rule, but in the Effect to Cause scheme, the structure is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example includes the general rule as part of the followed predicate. Wait, perhaps the followed predicate represents the causal link. So the first premise is that A occurred, and the second is that A is followed by B. So even if the general rule is not explicitly stated, in the computational form, it's captured by the followed predicate.

But in the user's text, only the occurrence of A is given. However, in order to form a complete argument according to the scheme, we need both premises. Therefore, the user's text is the first premise (occured(A)), and we have to infer the second premise (followed(occured(A), occurs(B)) and the conclusion (occurs(B)).

Therefore, the answer should be the computational form with the given premise and the inferred premise and conclusion. But how do we know what B is? In the example, B is increases(company, customer_satisfaction). So perhaps the same variables are used here. The given text is identical to the example's premise. Wait, the user's text is "In this case, the company provides excellent customer service." Which is exactly the same as the example's premise. Therefore, the computational form would be the same as the example's: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

But the user's text only provides the first part. However, according to the problem statement, the text is an enthymeme, which is part of the argument. Therefore, the answer must include all premises and conclusion as per the scheme. So even if the text only states one premise, the computational form must include all required premises and the conclusion. Therefore, the answer should match the example's structure, as the text is part of the same argument structure.

Therefore, the computational form is as in the example, because the text provided is the same as the example's premise. Hence, the answer is:

Final answer: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service),followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)),increases(company,customer_satisfaction))],increases(company,customer_satisfaction)


Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The task is to take the given natural language argument, which is an enthymeme (meaning it might be missing a premise or conclusion), and translate it into the correct computational form based on the provided argumentation schemes. 

First, I need to look at the context given. The user provided several argumentation schemes with examples. My job is to figure out which scheme the given text belongs to and then instantiate all the variables and predicates accordingly.

The text provided is: "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." 

Looking at the examples and schemes in the context:

1. **Analogy based on Classification**: Involves features and classification. The example talks about smartphones having certain features leading to classification. The given text doesn't mention features of two items or classifications, so probably not this one.

2. **Effect to Cause**: The scheme here is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example talks about providing customer service leading to increased satisfaction. The structure here is about an event A leading to B. The given text is a general statement that if A happens (attending classes), then B (improved performance) follows. This looks similar to the Effect to Cause example, which uses a general rule followed by an instance. Wait, but the example uses a premise where the company provides service, and then concludes satisfaction. The structure is: if A generally leads to B, then if A occurs, B occurs. So the scheme here would be that if A occurs and A is followed by B, then B occurs. 

3. **Need for Help**: Involves helping someone, being able to carry out an action, and it not being costly. Doesn't fit the text here.

4. **Argument from Opposites**: Involves opposites and properties. Not relevant here.

5. **Moral Justification Ad Populum**: Relates to what everyone does and goals. Not applicable.

6. **Classification Argument**: About classifications and subclasses. The example is "All eagles are birds...". The given text isn't about classification hierarchies.

7. **Necessary Condition**: Talks about goals and necessary conditions. The example is about investing in solar being necessary for renewable energy. The given text is about a conditional (if A then B), not a necessary condition for a goal.

8. **Position to Know**: Involves someone's authority leading to a claim. Not relevant here.

9. **Double Standard**: About applying different standards. Doesn't fit.

10. **Vagueness of Verbal Classification**: Deals with vague properties in contexts requiring precision. Not the case here.

The most likely scheme is **Effect to Cause**. The example for Effect to Cause is structured as a general rule followed by an instance. The given text "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve" seems like the general rule. However, the example in the Effect to Cause scheme has the premises [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(...)], and the conclusion. 

Wait, looking at the Effect to Cause example: 

Premises: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], conclusion: increases(company,customer_satisfaction).

But in the given text, the user only provides the general statement: "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." This is the general rule. However, the actual argument would require an instance where the student does attend, leading to the conclusion. But the text as given is just the general statement. Since it's an enthymeme, maybe the missing part is the occurrence of the antecedent. For example, if the text had said "In this case, the student attends regularly, therefore performance improves," then it would fit. But here, only the general statement is given. Wait, but the user's instruction says that the text is an enthymeme, which might be missing a premise or conclusion. So perhaps the full argument is:

Premise 1: Generally, if a student attends classes regularly (A), then their academic performance will improve (B).

Premise 2: In this case, the student attends regularly (A occurred).

Conclusion: Therefore, their academic performance improves (B occurs).

But the text given only has the first premise. The enthymeme is missing the second premise and the conclusion. However, the user might have intended to present the given text as a full argument, but in reality, it's just a general statement. Wait, but the example in the context for Effect to Cause includes both the general rule (as part of the followed predicate) and the occurrence of the antecedent. Wait, looking at the example:

The example's premises are [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], and the conclusion is increases(company,customer_satisfaction).

But the "Generally, if..." part is part of the followed predicate. So the followed predicate represents the general rule. So in the example, the followed(...) is the implication. So in the given text, the "Generally, if..." is the followed part. Then, if the argument had another premise where the antecedent occurs, then the conclusion would be the consequent. But in the text provided, perhaps only the general rule is stated, but maybe the user expects that in the computational form, we need to represent the general rule as the followed predicate, even if the actual occurrence isn't mentioned. Wait, but the text is an enthymeme, which means parts are missing. The user must infer the missing parts based on the scheme. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is the full argument as presented. Wait, the text is "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." That's just a general statement. But in the example, the Effect to Cause scheme uses a premise where the cause occurs, followed by the general rule. So perhaps the given text is just the general rule (the followed predicate), but without the occurrence of the cause. That would make the argument incomplete. However, the user might be providing this as the entire text, expecting that the computational form is only the followed predicate. But according to the scheme, the premises should be [occured(A), followed(A, B)], leading to conclusion occurs(B). So if the given text is only the followed(A, B) part, then the premises would be missing the occured(A) part. Therefore, the enthymeme here is missing the premise that the student does attend classes regularly. But the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps in the computational form, we have to represent the followed predicate, but maybe the given text is the entire argument as presented, which might be missing parts. 

Wait, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where the conclusion or premises might be missing. So the task is to infer the missing parts based on the argumentation scheme. The example in the context for Effect to Cause has two premises: the occurrence of the cause and the followed by relation. The conclusion is the effect. So if the given text is only stating the followed by relation (the general rule), but not the occurrence, then the enthymeme is missing the occurrence premise and the conclusion. However, in the example, the natural language example includes both the general rule and the specific occurrence. So perhaps the given text here is only the general rule part, and the missing parts are the occurrence of the cause and the conclusion. 

But the user instruction says "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So even if the text only provides the general rule, we need to infer the missing parts. Wait, but how? Maybe the text is part of an argument where the general rule is presented, and then in the actual argument, there's an instance where the cause occurs. But the text provided only has the general statement. So perhaps the computational form should include the followed predicate but with variables? Wait, the example in the context for Effect to Cause is structured as:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

In that example, the first premise is the occurrence of the cause (the company provides excellent service), the second premise is the followed by relation (if the cause occurs, then the effect occurs), and the conclusion is the effect. 

So in the given text, "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." This is the followed by relation. But the actual argument would need an occurrence of the cause. However, the text as provided doesn't state that the student does attend. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing that premise and the conclusion. But the user expects us to instantiate the variables and predicates based on the text. So perhaps the text is only the followed by part, and the rest is missing. But how do we represent that? Or perhaps the user made a mistake and the text is the entire argument, but it's incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the given text is a full argument where the conclusion is implicit. For example, the text is presented as a general rule, but the intended argument is that since the general rule holds, whenever the antecedent occurs, the consequent follows. But without the occurrence of the antecedent, the argument is incomplete. However, perhaps the user intended the text to be part of the Effect to Cause scheme, and thus the computational form should represent the followed by relation. 

Wait, but the structure for Effect to Cause is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So in the example, they have the occurrence of A (providing service), the followed by (if A occurs, then B occurs), leading to B. 

In the given text, the followed by part is present: "if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." But the occurrence of A (the student attending) is missing. So as an enthymeme, the missing premise is that the student does attend, and the conclusion is that their performance improves. However, the text provided only states the general rule. So the user must infer the missing parts. But how can we do that? 

Wait, maybe the text is not an enthymeme but a statement of the followed by relation. But the problem states that the text is an enthymeme. So the user has to infer what's missing. For example, if the full argument is: 

Premise 1: Generally, if a student attends classes regularly (A), then their academic performance will improve (B). 

Premise 2: Student X attends classes regularly (A occurred). 

Conclusion: Therefore, student X's academic performance improves (B occurs).

But in the given text, only Premise 1 is present. So to translate it into the computational form, we need to have the followed by predicate, but without the occurrence and conclusion. However, the problem says to "inferring the missing components". So maybe we have to represent the followed by relation, but leave the occurrence and conclusion as variables? But the instructions say to "FULLY instantiate ALL the variables and predicates", which suggests that we have to provide concrete terms, not variables. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given text is part of an argument where the conclusion is the followed by relation itself. But that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, looking back at the example in the Effect to Cause scheme:

The example's natural language argument is:

"Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase."

Which translates to:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the first part is the general rule (followed by), the second is the occurrence, and the conclusion is the effect.

In the given text, the natural language is only the general rule: "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." So the corresponding computational form would need to include the followed by predicate, but without the occurrence and the conclusion. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so parts are missing. Therefore, we need to infer the missing parts. 

But how can we infer the specific instance? Maybe the argument is presented as a general rule, and the missing parts are variables. Wait, but the instructions say to instantiate all variables and predicates. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the text is only the general statement, and the argumentation scheme requires both the general rule and the occurrence. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the occurrence premise and the conclusion. But since we have to instantiate all variables, perhaps the variables in the scheme are A and B, which in the example are specific actions. In the given text, A is "a student attends classes regularly" and B is "their academic performance will improve". 

But in the computational form, how are these represented? In the example, the followed predicate is followed(occured(A), occurs(B)). So for the given text, A is "student attends classes regularly" and B is "academic performance improves". 

But in the example, the 'occured' predicate takes an event. For instance, 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)' is the event. So in the given text, the event A is 'attends(student, classes_regularly)' or something like that. 

Therefore, the followed by predicate would be followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance))). 

But the problem is that the text is a general statement, not tied to a specific student. The example uses a specific company. Wait, in the example, the company is a specific entity. But in the given text, it's a general statement about any student. So perhaps we need to generalize. 

But the argumentation scheme's variables are events A and B. So the general form is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). 

In the example, the general rule is captured in the followed predicate. The specific event is the company providing service, leading to satisfaction. 

In the given text, the general rule is "if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve." So the followed by part is followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance))). 

But since the text is a general statement, perhaps the argument is that whenever A occurs, B follows. But in the computational form, do we need to represent this as a followed by relation between the occurrence of A and the occurrence of B? 

However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so parts are missing. The example includes both the general rule and the specific instance. Here, only the general rule is given. Therefore, the missing parts are the specific occurrence and the conclusion. But we can't infer specific instances without more information. Unless the text is part of a larger argument where the specific instance is assumed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is the entire argument, and the scheme is different. Wait, but the Effect to Cause scheme requires both the occurrence and the followed by. Since the text only provides the followed by, it's incomplete. 

Wait, but maybe the text is using the general rule as a premise, and the conclusion is that in any case where the antecedent occurs, the consequent follows. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is an instance of the Necessary Condition scheme. Let's check that. The Necessary Condition scheme is [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is about needing to invest in solar to pursue renewable energy goals. The given text is about regular attendance leading to improved performance. That seems like a causal relationship rather than a necessary condition. 

Alternatively, the Classification scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). The example is eagles being birds. Not relevant here. 

The Moral Justification Ad Populum: [everybody_who_is(Y,accept(P)), goal_of(X,Y)], should(X,accept(P)). Doesn't fit. 

So the best fit is still Effect to Cause. However, the text only provides the general rule (the followed by part). So in the computational form, we would have to represent the followed by predicate, but since the argument is an enthymeme missing the occurrence and conclusion, how do we represent that? 

Wait, the user instruction says "inferring the missing components". So perhaps we have to assume that there is a specific instance where a student attends classes, and the conclusion is their performance improves. But the text doesn't specify any particular student. Therefore, maybe the variables are left as general terms. 

But in the example, the variables are instantiated with specific terms. For instance, the event is 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)'. So perhaps in the given text, we need to abstract the events. 

The text is: "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve."

The event A is a student attending classes regularly. The effect B is academic performance improving. 

So the followed by predicate would be followed(occured(attends(Student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(Student_academic_performance))). 

But the variables here are Student and Student_academic_performance. However, in the example, the company is a constant, not a variable. So maybe we need to use a general term. 

Alternatively, perhaps the event is 'student_attends_regularly' and the effect is 'academic_performance_improves'. 

But how to represent them as predicates. 

In the example, the event is 'provides(company, excellent_customer_service)', which is a predicate. So the event here is 'attends(student, classes_regularly)'. But since it's a general statement, maybe we can represent it as a general event type. 

Wait, the Effect to Cause scheme is structured as:

[occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B)

In the example, A is the specific event of the company providing service. So in the given text, if we have a general rule, perhaps the 'followed' predicate is between the event type and the effect type. 

Alternatively, maybe the variables in the scheme are:

A is an event type, and B is another event type, and the scheme is that whenever an event of type A occurs, then an event of type B occurs. 

But the example uses specific events. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. 

Alternatively, perhaps the scheme uses the general rule as the 'followed' predicate, and when combined with an occurrence of A, it leads to B. 

But in the given text, only the general rule is present, so the computational form would only have the 'followed' predicate. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so it's missing parts. Therefore, to fully instantiate the scheme, we need to include the missing premises and conclusion. 

But without specific information about a particular student attending, how can we do that? Maybe the enthymeme is presented as the general rule, and the missing parts are variables. But the instructions say to fully instantiate, so variables should be replaced with constants. 

Wait, perhaps the text is part of an argument where the speaker is asserting the general rule, and the intended use is that whenever someone attends, their performance improves. So in the computational form, the 'followed' predicate would be between the event types. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer should be:

[followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly), occurs(improves(academic_performance))], occurs(improves(academic_performance))

But this is missing the occurrence premise. However, the text only provides the general rule. So perhaps the computational form is incomplete, but the user expects us to use the scheme and infer that the occurrence is missing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is an instance of the Necessary Condition scheme. For example, if the goal is to improve academic performance, then attending classes is necessary. But the text doesn't mention a goal. 

No, the text is a conditional statement about attendance leading to improvement, which fits the Effect to Cause scheme. 

Given all this, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the text is the general rule part of the Effect to Cause scheme. However, since the text is an enthymeme, it's missing the specific occurrence and conclusion. But the problem requires us to instantiate all variables and predicates from the scheme given the text. 

Wait, the example in the context for Effect to Cause includes both the occurrence and the followed by in the premises. But the given text only has the followed by part. Therefore, to instantiate the scheme, we need to include the followed by predicate. But without the occurrence, we can't form the full premises. However, the user instruction says to infer the missing components. 

Wait, perhaps the text is the full argument as presented, but it's missing the conclusion. For example, in the example, the natural language argument has two premises and a conclusion. The given text here has one premise (the general rule) and maybe the conclusion is missing. But how can we form the conclusion without the occurrence premise? 

Alternatively, maybe the text is an incomplete argument where the user is supposed to fill in the missing parts. For example, the full argument would be:

1. Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve. [followed(occured(attends(S, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance(S)))]

2. Student X attends classes regularly. [occured(attends(X, classes_regularly))]

Conclusion: Therefore, student X's academic performance improves. [occurs(improves(academic_performance(X)))]

But since the text only provides premise 1, the enthymeme is missing premise 2 and the conclusion. However, the user instruction says to infer the missing components. But how can we infer a specific student? Unless the variables are kept as variables. 

But the example in the context uses specific constants, not variables. For instance, 'company' is a constant. Therefore, perhaps in the given text, we can use a generic student, like 'student' as a constant. 

So the computational form would be:

[followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(academic_performance))

But this would require the occurrence premise to be present, which it isn't. Therefore, this approach doesn't fit the scheme. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended the text to be the entire argument, which is a general rule, and thus the conclusion is that whenever a student attends, their performance improves. But the scheme requires specific occurrences. 

I think I'm stuck here. Let me look back at the problem statement. 

The user says: "You must correctly identify to which argumentation scheme the presented argument belongs. The text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples."

The text is: "Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve."

The example for Effect to Cause has a structure where the premises are the occurrence of the cause and the followed by relation. The given text is the followed by relation. So if the text is part of an Effect to Cause argument, it's missing the occurrence premise. However, the problem requires us to instantiate all variables and predicates. Since the text is missing parts, we need to infer them. 

Wait, maybe the text is part of a modus ponens argument, which is:

If A then B.

A.

Therefore, B.

The given text is the "If A then B" part. The missing parts are "A" and "B". But the problem is to represent the given text as per the scheme. 

In the Effect to Cause scheme, the structure is [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). 

The given text is the "followed(occured(A), occurs(B))" part. So if the text is just that, then the computational form would be [followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], but that's not a complete argument. 

However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so parts are missing. Therefore, we need to infer the missing parts. But without additional information, how can we do that? 

Perhaps the answer is to recognize that the text corresponds to the 'followed' part of the Effect to Cause scheme, and the variables are instantiated based on the text. So:

A is 'attends(student, classes_regularly)'

B is 'improves(academic_performance)'

So the followed predicate is followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance))).

But since the text only provides the general rule, the premises would only have the followed predicate. However, the scheme requires two premises: the occurrence and the followed by. 

But maybe in the enthymeme, the occurrence is assumed. For example, if the argument is used in a context where the student does attend, then the missing premise is assumed. But without knowing that, we can't fill it in. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is intended to be the entire argument, and the computational form is just the followed predicate. But that doesn't fit the scheme. 

This is getting confusing. Let's try to look at the example again. The example's premises are:

[occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))]

So the 'followed' predicate includes the event and the effect. 

In the given text, the event is 'student attends regularly', and the effect is 'academic performance improves'. Therefore, the 'followed' predicate would be:

followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), improves(academic_performance))

But in the example, the effect in the followed predicate is 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)', which is a predicate. So perhaps 'improves(academic_performance)' should be a predicate with the student as an argument. 

Wait, perhaps the academic performance is of the student, so it's improves(student_academic_performance). 

But in the example, 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)' has the company as the first argument. So perhaps the effect is 'improves(student, academic_performance)'. 

But the text says "their academic performance", referring to the student. So in predicate form, it would be improves(student, academic_performance). 

Putting it all together, the followed predicate is:

followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(student, academic_performance)))

But the example uses 'increases(company, customer_satisfaction)' as the effect. 

So the computational form for the given text would be:

[followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(student, academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(student, academic_performance))

But according to the scheme, the premises should include the occurrence of the cause and the followed by relation. The conclusion is the effect. 

Since the text only provides the followed by relation, the premises are missing the occurrence. Therefore, the computational form would be incomplete. But the user instructs to infer the missing components. 

Wait, perhaps the text is part of an argument where the general rule is asserted, and the user is to represent it as the followed predicate. But without the occurrence, the argument can't be completed. However, the problem states that the text belongs to one of the schemes, so it must fit one. 

Given that, I think the correct answer is to recognize that the text is an instance of the Effect to Cause argumentation scheme, where the followed by relation is present. The missing premises and conclusion would be added based on the scheme. 

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(academic_performance))

But the text doesn't mention the occurrence of the student attending. So how can we include that? 

The problem says to "infer the missing components". So maybe we have to assume that the student does attend, based on the general statement. But that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is not missing premises but is just a general statement, which doesn't fit any scheme. But that can't be, as per the problem statement. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is using the Necessary Condition scheme. Let me check. 

Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). 

Example: Goal is to pursue advancements in renewable energy. Necessary condition is investing in solar. Conclusion: invest in solar is necessary. 

The given text is about attending classes leading to improved performance. If the goal is to improve performance, then attending is a necessary condition. But the text doesn't mention a goal. So unless the goal is inferred, it doesn't fit. 

But the text starts with "Generally, if...", which is a conditional, not a goal. 

Therefore, it's more likely to be Effect to Cause. 

Given all this, I think the answer should be structured as follows:

The argument belongs to the Effect to Cause Argumentation scheme. The given text provides the followed by relation. The missing premise is the occurrence of the cause (student attending), and the conclusion is the effect (academic performance improves). 

But to fully instantiate, we need to include all parts. However, since the text doesn't provide the occurrence, we have to infer it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is considered to have the followed by relation as the premise, and the conclusion is the general rule. But that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, the example's followed by predicate includes both the cause and effect. The given text is the followed by part. So perhaps the computational form is:

[followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(academic_performance))

But according to the scheme, the premises should be [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], and conclusion is occurs(B). 

Therefore, without the occured(A) premise, the argument is invalid. So the text is missing that premise. But the user says to infer the missing components. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is the entire argument, which is invalid, but belongs to the Effect to Cause scheme. But that's not possible. 

This is quite confusing. I think the key here is that the text is an enthymeme, and the task is to fill in the missing parts based on the scheme. 

Assuming that the text is the general rule (the followed by part), and the missing parts are the occurrence and the conclusion. For example, if the argument is made in a context where a specific student is being referred to, then:

Premise 1: Generally, if a student attends classes regularly, then their academic performance will improve. [followed(occured(attends(S, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(S, academic_performance)))]

Premise 2: Student X attends regularly. [occured(attends(X, classes_regularly))]

Conclusion: Therefore, student X's academic performance improves. [occurs(improves(X, academic_performance))]

But since the text doesn't mention a specific student, how can we instantiate this? Maybe we use a generic student. 

So the computational form would be:

[occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(student, academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(student, academic_performance))

But the text doesn't state that the student attends. So this is inferring the missing premise. 

But is this acceptable? The user instruction says to infer the missing components. So yes. 

Therefore, the answer would be:

[occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(student, academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(student, academic_performance))

But wait, the text only states the general rule, not the occurrence. So why are we including the occurrence in the premises? Because the scheme requires it. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the occurrence premise, and we have to infer that it exists. 

But how can we infer that a specific student attends? Maybe the text is abstract, and we use a general student. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is using variables. But the example uses constants. 

This is quite a challenge. Given the example, the followed by relation is between specific events. So in the given text, we can represent the event as a general type. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the text is only the followed by relation, and thus the computational form only includes that. But according to the scheme, that's incomplete. 

Alternatively, the problem might have a mistake, and the correct scheme is Necessary Condition. Let me double-check. 

If the argument is that attending classes is a necessary condition for improving performance, then the scheme would require a goal and a necessary condition. But the text doesn't mention a goal. 

No, the text is a simple conditional. Therefore, I think the correct scheme is Effect to Cause. 

Given all this, I will proceed to write the computational form as per the Effect to Cause scheme, assuming that the missing premise is the occurrence of the cause. However, since the text doesn't provide it, I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the text is the entire argument, and the followed by relation is considered sufficient. But that doesn't fit the scheme. 

Wait, looking at the example again, the natural language example includes both the general rule and the specific occurrence. The computational form includes both premises. Therefore, the given text, which is only the general rule, would correspond to only the 'followed' predicate in the premises. But according to the scheme, that's insufficient. 

But the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so parts are missing. Therefore, the correct approach is to represent the given part and note the missing parts. But the user instructs to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

Therefore, we must infer the missing components. 

Assuming that the argument is being made in a context where a student is attending regularly, then the missing premise is that occurrence, and the conclusion is the improvement. 

But without a specific student, perhaps we use a placeholder. For example, the student is 'student', and the event is 'attends(student, classes_regularly)'. 

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), followed(occured(attends(student, classes_regularly)), occurs(improves(student, academic_performance)))], occurs(improves(student, academic_performance))

This includes both premises (occurrence and followed by) and the conclusion, even though the text only provides the followed by. The occurrence is inferred as missing and added. 

But is this acceptable? The user says to infer the missing components. Since the text is an enthymeme missing the occurrence premise and conclusion, we infer them. 

Yes, I think this is the correct approach.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme, which is an argument where either the conclusion or a premise is missing. The task is to translate this into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to understand the structure of the provided argument. The text given is: "In this case, the road is well-maintained." That's a single premise. The example in the context that might fit this is the Effect to Cause argumentation scheme. Let me check that scheme again.

The Effect to Cause scheme has the structure [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example they gave was about a company providing excellent service leading to increased customer satisfaction. The premise here is that A occurred (the company provides service), and A is followed by B (customer satisfaction increases), leading to the conclusion that B occurs.

But wait, the given text is "the road is well-maintained." That seems more like a current state rather than an event that causes another. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong scheme. Let me check the others.

Looking at the Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example was about pursuing renewable energy requiring investment in solar. The text here doesn't mention goals or necessary conditions.

What about the Classification scheme? It uses [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). The example was eagles being birds. If the argument was that the road is well-maintained, perhaps leading to a classification? But the given text is just a premise without a conclusion. Wait, the user mentioned that the enthymeme might have a missing conclusion or premise. So maybe the conclusion is missing here.

Wait, the example for Effect to Cause required two premises: that A occurred and that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B. But in the user's text, there's only one premise. So maybe the user's argument is missing a premise and the conclusion. For instance, if the full argument is: "If a road is well-maintained, then accidents decrease. The road is well-maintained. Therefore, accidents will decrease." But the user only provided "In this case, the road is well-maintained." So the missing parts would be the general rule (if A then B) and the conclusion (B). 

But the Effect to Cause scheme in the context uses [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So the first premise is that A occurred, and the second is that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B. The user's text has only "the road is well-maintained," which would correspond to A occurred. So the missing parts would be the followed premise and the conclusion.

But how does the example in the context structure the Effect to Cause? The example's premises are [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], and the conclusion is increases(company,customer_satisfaction). So the first premise is the occurrence of A (providing service), the second is that A is followed by B (increased satisfaction), leading to B.

In the user's case, the road being well-maintained (A) would need a second premise that A leads to B (some effect), then the conclusion is B. But the user only provided A. So the enthymeme is missing the general rule (A followed by B) and the conclusion (B). However, the user's instruction says that the argument might be missing a premise or conclusion. But the answer requires instantiating all variables and predicates from the scheme.

Wait, the user's text is "In this case, the road is well-maintained." Maybe the conclusion is missing. For example, maybe the full argument is: "If a road is well-maintained, then it's safe to drive on. The road is well-maintained. Therefore, it's safe to drive on." So here, the Effect to Cause would have: occurred(road_well_maintained), followed(road_well_maintained, safe_to_drive), so conclusion is safe_to_drive.

But the user's text is only providing "the road is well-maintained" as a premise. So in the computational form, we need to have the two premises and the conclusion. Since the user's text is an enthymeme, we need to infer the missing parts. However, the user's text is the only premise given. Therefore, perhaps the original argument is missing the general rule and the conclusion, but the user's example in the context for Effect to Cause has the general rule as a premise and the specific occurrence as another premise.

But in the example provided in the context, the Effect to Cause example was structured with the general rule as part of the premises. Wait, no. Let me check again. The example's premises were "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." Then the computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). So the first premise is the occurrence of the action, the second is that the occurrence of the action is followed by the effect. The general rule is part of the second premise. So in the user's case, the premise given is the occurrence of the road being maintained. But the second premise would be that this occurrence is followed by some effect (e.g., fewer accidents). However, the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps this isn't the right scheme.

Alternatively, maybe the argument is part of another scheme. Let's look at the other schemes. The Classification scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, all eagles are birds, white eagles are eagles, so white eagles are birds. But the user's text is about the road being well-maintained. Maybe the conclusion is that the road is classified in some category, but there's no mention of a classification.

The Necessary Condition scheme: if the road being maintained is a necessary condition for some goal. But the text doesn't mention a goal.

The Position to Know scheme: if someone in a position to know asserts something. But the text is a statement about the road, not an authority's assertion.

The Moral Justification Ad Populum: if everyone who is Y accepts P, and X's goal is Y, then X should accept P. Doesn't seem to fit.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: if something has a vague property in a context that requires precision. The user's text is about the road being well-maintained, which is a positive statement, not vague.

Double Standard: applying different standards. Not relevant here.

Need for Help: if an action would help, can be done, not too costly. Not applicable.

Argument from Opposites: if something has a property and is opposite, then the opposite has the opposite property. Doesn't fit.

So, back to Effect to Cause. The user's text seems to be the occurrence of A (road is well-maintained). But without the general rule (A leads to B) and the conclusion (B), the argument is incomplete. So, the enthymeme might be missing those parts. However, the user's instruction says to infer the missing components based on the argumentation scheme. Since the text is "In this case, the road is well-maintained," and assuming the scheme is Effect to Cause, we need to see what's missing.

But wait, in the example, the premises are two: the occurrence of the action and the followed by relation. So, the user's text is only providing the occurrence. However, perhaps the argument is presented as a single premise, and the conclusion is inferred. But the scheme requires both premises. Therefore, maybe this isn't the correct scheme.

Wait, perhaps the scheme is the Necessary Condition. Let me check again. The Necessary Condition scheme is [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). For example, if the goal is to pursue renewable energy, and investing in solar is necessary, then investing is necessary.

But the user's text is "the road is well-maintained." If the goal was, say, safe driving, and maintaining the road is necessary for that, then the conclusion would be that maintaining the road is necessary. But the text only states that the road is maintained, not that it's a necessary condition for a goal.

Alternatively, maybe the road being well-maintained is a necessary condition for something else. But the text doesn't mention a goal. So this seems less likely.

Alternatively, the argument is using the Classification scheme. Suppose the argument is: All well-maintained roads are safe. This road is well-maintained. Therefore, it's safe. But that would be a Classification scheme? Wait, the Classification scheme in the context is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, classification(eagle, bird), be(white_eagle, eagle), so white_eagle is bird. So if well-maintained roads are classified as safe, and this road is a well-maintained road, then it's safe. But the user's text only has "the road is well-maintained." The conclusion would be "the road is safe," but the missing premise is the classification rule (all well-maintained roads are safe). So the computational form would be [classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, safe_road). But the user's text only gives the second premise. So the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. But the user's instruction says to infer the missing components. However, the user might have intended this to be part of the Classification scheme. But how to decide between Effect to Cause and Classification?

Alternatively, the example in the context for Classification is "All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds." The scheme is based on class inclusion. The user's argument might be similar: "All well-maintained roads are classified as safe. This road is well-maintained. Therefore, it's safe." But the original text only provides the second premise. So the missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion. If that's the case, the correct scheme would be Classification. But the user's text doesn't mention any classification, just a feature of the road. Alternatively, the scheme might be Analogy based on Classification, but in the example provided, Analogy based on Classification requires two items with similar features, one classified, leading the other to be classified. The user's text doesn't mention two items, only one.

Wait, the user's text is "In this case, the road is well-maintained." So maybe the conclusion is missing. Suppose the full argument is that because the road is well-maintained, it should be classified as safe. Then the premises would be: features(road, well_maintained), classified(road, safe). But the example for Analogy based on Classification requires features of two items. Since the user's text only mentions one item (the road), perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the argument is using the Position to Know scheme. If an authority (like a road engineer) says the road is well-maintained, then we can conclude it's safe. But the user's text doesn't mention an authority.

Alternatively, the argument could be part of the Moral Justification Ad Populum, but that's about accepting a proposition based on others' acceptance.

Alternatively, the argument is from the Necessary Condition. Suppose the goal is safe driving, and maintaining the road is a necessary condition. But the user's text doesn't mention the goal.

Given all this, perhaps the most plausible scheme is the Effect to Cause. However, the user's text is only providing the premise that A occurred (road is well-maintained). The other premise would be that A is followed by B (some effect), and the conclusion is B. But since the user's text doesn't mention B, perhaps the conclusion is missing. For example, "Therefore, traffic will flow smoothly."

But the user's instruction says that the answer must instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. So, for the Effect to Cause scheme, we need two premises: occured(A) and followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), leading to occurs(B). The user's text provides occured(A) where A is the road being well-maintained. But what is B? Since it's missing, we need to infer B. However, without additional context, it's hard to know. But the user might expect that the missing premise and conclusion are part of the scheme. For example, maybe the argument is that the road is well-maintained, and well-maintained roads lead to safer driving, so safer driving occurs. But how to represent that.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is structured such that the first premise is the occurrence of the road being well-maintained, and the second premise is that such an occurrence is followed by the conclusion, which might be "the road is safe." But the user's text is incomplete. However, the answer must infer the missing parts. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is part of a different scheme. Let me check again. The user's text is "In this case, the road is well-maintained." Suppose this is the entire argument. Then, perhaps the intended scheme is the Classification scheme. If the argument is "All well-maintained roads are safe. This road is well-maintained. Therefore, it is safe." But again, the user's text only gives one premise. But the example in the Classification scheme requires two premises: classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The user's text would be the second premise (be(A,F)), so the missing parts are classification(F,G) and the conclusion.

But the user's instruction says to "infer the missing components by inferring the context of the rest of the argumentation scheme." So, we need to assume that the missing premise is the classification rule and the conclusion. Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, safe_road). But the user's text only gives the "be" premise. So, the variables and predicates would be classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road), and the conclusion be(this_road, safe_road). However, the user's text is only the "be" premise. So, this would fit the Classification scheme.

But how to decide between Effect to Cause and Classification? Let me look at the user's example for Classification. The example is "All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds." The premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle). So, if the user's argument is structured similarly, then the missing parts would be the classification premise (all well-maintained roads are classified as something) and the conclusion. But the user's text only states that the road is well-maintained. So, the conclusion would be that the road is classified as that something.

Alternatively, maybe the user's argument is part of the Analogy based on Classification. But that requires two items with the same features. For example, if there's another road that is well-maintained and classified as safe, then this road should be too. But the user's text only mentions one road.

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is part of the Necessary Condition scheme. Suppose the goal is to have safe roads, and maintaining them is a necessary condition. Then the conclusion would be that maintaining roads is necessary. But the user's text is "the road is well-maintained," which is the necessary condition being met. But the scheme requires the goal and the necessary condition. The user's text doesn't mention the goal.

Given all this, the most plausible scheme seems to be the Effect to Cause, where the premise is that the road is well-maintained (A occurred), and there's an implicit general rule that well-maintained roads lead to some effect (B). But since the user hasn't provided B, we need to infer it. However, without explicit information, it's challenging. 

Wait, the user's text is just "In this case, the road is well-maintained." Without any conclusion or another premise, perhaps this is part of a larger argument that's not fully provided. But according to the instructions, I need to translate the given argument into the computational form by inferring the missing parts based on the scheme.

But how do I know which scheme to choose? Looking at the example provided for Effect to Cause, the premises are the occurrence and the followed-by relation. The user's text only provides the occurrence. So, perhaps the argument is incomplete, but the scheme requires both premises. Therefore, maybe this isn't the correct scheme.

Alternatively, maybe the text is part of the Classification scheme. If "well-maintained" is a feature that leads to classification, then the premises would be that being well-maintained is classified under a certain category, and the road has that feature. But the example requires the classification premise and the be premise. The user's text is the be premise. So, the missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion.

But without knowing the classification category, it's hard to instantiate. However, the user's example uses 'flagship device' as a classification. So, perhaps in this case, the road being well-maintained is classified as, say, a 'safe road.' But the user's text doesn't mention that. However, the instruction says to infer the missing components.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is using the Classification scheme with the road being classified as something. For example:

Premise 1: classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road)
Premise 2: be(this_road, well_maintained_road)
Conclusion: be(this_road, safe_road)

But the user's text only provides premise 2. So the computational form would be [classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, safe_road). However, the user's text is just the second premise. But the instruction says to infer missing components. So maybe we have to include the classification premise and the conclusion even though they're not in the text. But this is risky because we're assuming the classification. However, in the example for the Classification scheme, the premises include both the classification and the be statement.

Alternatively, the user's text is part of the Analogy based on Classification. For example, if another road with the same features is classified as safe, then this road should be too. But the user's text only mentions one road.

This is getting confusing. Let me look back at the user's instruction. The user says that the text belongs to exactly one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples. So I need to check which scheme's structure fits best with the given text when missing parts are inferred.

The given text: "In this case, the road is well-maintained." If this is the entire premise, then the conclusion must be inferred. For example, maybe the road should be classified in a certain way (Classification scheme) or that some effect will occur (Effect to Cause).

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, looking at the example for the Effect to Cause, the structure is two premises: occurrence of A and A is followed by B. So, if the user's text is the occurrence of A, then the missing premise is that A is followed by B, and the conclusion is B.

But what would B be? Maybe the road being safe. For example:

Premise 1: occurred(road_well_maintained)
Premise 2: followed(occurred(road_well_maintained), occurs(road_safe))
Conclusion: occurs(road_safe)

But the user's text only has premise 1. So the computational form would be [occurred(road_well_maintained), followed(occurred(road_well_maintained), occurs(road_safe))], occurs(road_safe). But how to represent "road_safe"?

Alternatively, the variables would be:

A: road_well_maintained
B: road_safe

So the computational form is [occurred(road_well_maintained), followed(occurred(road_well_maintained), occurs(road_safe))], occurs(road_safe)

But the user's text only provides occurred(A). So the missing parts are the followed premise and the conclusion.

But how to determine B? Since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps we need to use placeholders. However, the user's example in the context for Effect to Cause uses specific terms. So perhaps the B is inferred as the effect that follows from a well-maintained road, such as reduced accidents.

But without explicit information, it's speculative. However, the instruction says to infer the missing components. So perhaps the answer is:

[occured(road_is_well_maintained), followed(occured(road_is_well_maintained), occurs(reduced_accidents))], occurs(reduced_accidents)

But how to verify this? The user's text doesn't mention reduced accidents. So this is a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is using the Classification scheme. Suppose the road is well-maintained, and well-maintained roads are classified as safe. Then the conclusion is the road is safe. So the computational form would be [classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, safe_road)

But again, the user's text only has the second premise. However, the instruction says to infer the missing parts.

Given the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is the Effect to Cause scheme. Because "In this case, the road is well-maintained" sounds like a premise leading to an effect. But without more info, it's hard. However, looking back at the example in the context for Effect to Cause, the premises are the occurrence and the followed by. So the user's text would need to have both. But the user's text only has one. So maybe this isn't the correct scheme.

Wait, the example in the context for the Necessary Condition scheme is:

[goal(pursue(advancements,renewable_energy_techonology)), necessary_condition(pursue(advancements,renewable_energy_techonology), invest(solar_power_infrastructure))], is_necessary(invest(solar_power_infrastructure))

Here, the premises are the goal and the necessary condition. The user's text doesn't mention a goal, so probably not this.

The Position to Know scheme requires someone in a position to know making an assertion. The user's text is a statement about the road, not an assertion by an authority.

The Moral Justification Ad Populum involves everybody who is Y accepting P. Not applicable here.

The Argument from Opposites requires opposites. The user's text doesn't mention opposites.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: not relevant here.

Double Standard: also not relevant.

Need for Help: doesn't fit.

So, after eliminating other schemes, the remaining options are Effect to Cause and Classification.

Given that the user's text is "In this case, the road is well-maintained," if we consider that this is part of an argument where the road's maintenance leads to an effect, then Effect to Cause. But if it's about classification, then the Classification scheme.

But how to decide? Let's look at the example of the Classification scheme again. The premises are classification(F, G) and be(A, F), leading to be(A, G). The user's text is be(A, F), so the missing parts are classification(F, G) and the conclusion be(A, G). If we assume that well-maintained roads are classified as safe, then the conclusion is the road is safe. But how to know what G is? It's inferred.

Alternatively, maybe the road being well-maintained is a feature that classifies it into a certain category, like a 'priority route'. But without more info, it's speculative.

However, considering the example given for the Classification scheme, which uses a straightforward class inclusion (eagles are birds), the user's text might be part of a similar argument. For instance:

Premise 1: All well-maintained roads are priority routes. (classification(F, G))
Premise 2: This road is well-maintained. (be(A, F))
Conclusion: Therefore, this road is a priority route. (be(A, G))

But the user's text only provides premise 2. Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(well_maintained_road, priority_route), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, priority_route)

However, the user's text doesn't mention priority routes. But the instruction says to infer the missing components. So perhaps this is the case.

Alternatively, the example in the context uses 'eagle' and 'bird', which are natural categories. The user's text uses 'well-maintained' which is a feature, not a category. So maybe the Classification scheme isn't the best fit.

Returning to the Effect to Cause scheme, perhaps the argument is structured as follows:

Premise 1: The road is well-maintained. (occurred(A))
Premise 2: A well-maintained road leads to increased safety. (followed(occurred(A), occurs(B)))
Conclusion: Therefore, safety is increased. (occurs(B))

But again, the user's text only provides premise 1. However, the instruction requires us to infer the missing parts. So the computational form would be:

[occured(road_well_maintained), followed(occured(road_well_maintained), occurs(increased_safety))], occurs(increased_safety)

But the user's text doesn't mention increased safety. However, this is an inference.

Given that the user's example for Effect to Cause includes both premises and the conclusion, even though the natural language example states the general rule as part of the premises, perhaps the user's text is intended to be part of the Effect to Cause scheme with the missing parts inferred.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is using the Necessary Condition scheme. If the goal is to have safe roads, and maintaining them is a necessary condition, then the conclusion is that maintaining is necessary. But the user's text states that the road is maintained, not that it's a necessary condition.

I think the most plausible answer is the Effect to Cause scheme. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(road_well_maintained), followed(occured(road_well_maintained), occurs(B))], occurs(B)

But we need to instantiate B. Since the user's text doesn't specify, maybe B is something like 'safe_driving_conditions' or 'reduced_accidents'. However, the example in the context uses specific terms, so we need to make it concrete.

Alternatively, maybe the user's text is part of the Position to Know scheme. If someone in a position to know (like a city official) asserts that the road is well-maintained, then we can conclude it's true. But the user's text doesn't mention an authority.

After considering all possibilities, I think the intended answer is the Effect to Cause argumentation scheme. The user's text provides the occurrence of the road being well-maintained (A), and the missing premise is that A leads to B (like safety), leading to the conclusion B. 

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(road_is_well_maintained), followed(occured(road_is_well_maintained), occurs(safe_driving_conditions))], occurs(safe_driving_conditions)

But I need to check the exact syntax from the example. In the example, the first premise is occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), and the second is followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction)).

So for the user's case:

occured(road_well_maintained)
followed(occured(road_well_maintained), occurs(safe_driving_conditions))

But 'road_well_maintained' could be represented as an event, perhaps maintain(road) or road_maintained.

Wait, in the example, the occurrence is an action (provides), so maybe 'maintain(road)' is the action. But the user's text is "the road is well-maintained," which is a state. So perhaps the event is the road being maintained. Maybe represented as road_maintained.

Thus, the premises would be:

occured(road_maintained)
followed(occured(road_maintained), occurs(safe_driving))

Conclusion: occurs(safe_driving)

But the user's text is "the road is well-maintained," which is a state, not an event. So maybe this isn't the right fit. The Effect to Cause scheme seems to require an event (something that occurred), not a state. 

Alternatively, perhaps the state is considered as an occurrence. For example, "the road being well-maintained occurred," which is a bit awkward. But in the example, the company providing service is an event.

This makes me think that maybe the Effect to Cause scheme isn't the correct fit. Because the user's text is describing a state, not an event.

Therefore, perhaps the correct scheme is the Classification scheme. Even though the user's text only provides one premise, if we infer that there's a classification rule and a conclusion, then it fits.

For example, the road is well-maintained (be(this_road, well_maintained_road)), and if well-maintained roads are classified as safe (classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road)), then the conclusion is this road is safe (be(this_road, safe_road)).

So the computational form would be:

[classification(well_maintained_road, safe_road), be(this_road, well_maintained_road)], be(this_road, safe_road)

This fits the Classification scheme's structure.

Given that the user's text is "the road is well-maintained," which is the 'be(A,F)' premise, and the missing 'classification(F,G)' premise is inferred, along with the conclusion, this seems plausible.

Therefore, the correct argumentation scheme is Classification.


Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context given. Let's start by understanding what's required here.

First, the given text is: "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." The user mentioned this is an enthymeme, so either the conclusion or a premise might be missing. My job is to identify which argumentation scheme this fits into and then fill in the missing parts to form the computational representation.

Looking at the context examples, there are several argumentation schemes. Let's go through each to see which one matches.

The Effect to Cause scheme is structured as [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). The example given talks about if a company provides good service (A), then satisfaction increases (B). The premises are that A occurred and A is followed by B, leading to the conclusion B occurs. The given text here is a general statement: "when someone gets enough sleep (A), their cognitive performance improves (B)." This seems like a general cause-effect relationship. So the structure here would be a general rule followed by an instance. Wait, the example in the Effect to Cause scheme starts with a general statement as well. Let me check the example again. The example says, "Generally, if a company provides excellent customer service, then customer satisfaction will increase. In this case, the company provides excellent customer service. Therefore, customer satisfaction will increase." So the premises are the general rule (followed by occurrence of A leading to B) and the occurrence of A, leading to conclusion B. 

But in the given text here, the user only provided the general statement: "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." That's the general rule. But where's the specific instance? Maybe the enthymeme is missing the premise that "someone got enough sleep," leading to the conclusion that their cognitive performance improved. So the full argument would be:

Premise 1: If someone gets enough sleep (A), then their cognitive performance improves (B). [followed(occured(A), occurs(B))]
Premise 2: The person got enough sleep (A occurred).
Conclusion: Therefore, their cognitive performance improves (B occurs).

But in the user's text, only the general premise is given. So maybe the user's example is incomplete, and the computational form would require both premises. However, the text provided is only the general statement. Wait, maybe the user is presenting the argument as the general rule (the effect to cause structure) without the specific instance. But according to the Effect to Cause scheme in the context, the premises are [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], so the general rule is part of the followed predicate. For example, in the example, the first premise is the general rule, but in the computational form, it's represented as followed(occured(provides...), increases...). Wait, looking back:

Effect to Cause example's computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

So the first premise is that the action occurred (A), the second is that A is followed by B. But in the example's natural language, they state the general rule first ("if a company provides..."), then the specific occurrence ("the company provides..."), leading to the conclusion. So in the computational form, the general rule is part of the 'followed' predicate. So in the given text, the user's input is the general rule. But in order to form a complete argument, there needs to be a specific instance where A occurs. However, the user's text only includes the general statement. That suggests that the argument as presented is missing the specific instance premise and the conclusion. But the task is to infer the missing components. So maybe the enthymeme is the general premise, and the conclusion is missing, but in the example provided in the context, the argument includes both the general rule and the specific case. Wait, the user's text says "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." That's the general rule. To form an argument using the Effect to Cause scheme, we would need a specific case where someone got enough sleep, leading to the conclusion that their cognitive performance improves. But the text provided only has the general statement. So perhaps the user's argument is incomplete, and we need to infer that there's a specific case where A (enough sleep) occurred, leading to B (improved cognitive performance). But the problem says that the text is an enthymeme where the conclusion or premises might be missing. So in this case, the text is the general premise, but the specific premise (A occurred) and conclusion (B occurs) are missing. However, the example in the context for Effect to Cause includes both the general and specific premise. Wait, in the example, the argument is structured as:

Premise 1 (general): If A, then B.

Premise 2 (specific): A occurred.

Conclusion: Therefore, B occurs.

So in the user's text, the given is the general premise. The missing parts would be the specific premise and the conclusion. But how does that fit into the computational form? Let's look at the Effect to Cause scheme's computational form: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). In the example, the first element is occured(A), which is the specific case, and followed(...) which is the general rule. So the user's text is only providing the followed(...) part (the general rule), but in the computational form, we need to have both occured(A) and followed(occured(A), occurs(B)). Therefore, the user's text is missing the specific occurrence of A and the conclusion B. But the problem says that the text is an enthymeme where parts are missing. Therefore, the user's text corresponds to the 'followed' part of the premises, and we need to infer the rest.

Wait, the text is "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." This is the general rule, which in the computational form would be the 'followed(occured(A), occurs(B))' part. The missing parts would be the specific occurrence (occured(A)) and the conclusion (occurs(B)). However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where parts are missing. So to form the full argument, the user would need to supply both the general rule and the specific instance. But in the given text, only the general rule is present. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the specific premise and conclusion. But the task is to "infer the missing components" based on the argumentation scheme. So, if the argumentation scheme is Effect to Cause, then the premises would be:

1. occured(A) (specific instance)
2. followed(occured(A), occurs(B)) (general rule)

Conclusion: occurs(B)

But in the user's text, only the general rule is provided. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing the specific premise and the conclusion. However, in order to instantiate the variables and predicates, we need to see if the text provides enough information. Let's parse the text again: "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." Here, "when someone gets enough sleep" is the antecedent (A), and "their cognitive performance improves" is the consequent (B). So, the 'followed' predicate would link A to B. But in the computational form for Effect to Cause, the first premise is that A occurred, and the second is that A is followed by B. Then the conclusion is B occurs. So in the given text, the 'followed' part is present, but the specific occurrence (A) is missing. Therefore, the argument as presented is missing the specific occurrence. However, the problem says that we must infer the missing components. But how can we infer a specific occurrence if it's not mentioned? Maybe the user intended to present the argument as a general statement, but in the example, the general statement is part of the 'followed' predicate. So perhaps the text is the general rule, and the argument would be presented as the general rule (followed) along with the specific occurrence (occured(A)), leading to the conclusion. But since the text only gives the general rule, maybe the specific occurrence is implicit. Wait, but the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, which typically has a missing premise or conclusion. In this case, the conclusion might be missing. For example, the argument could be structured as:

Premise 1 (general): When someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves.

Premise 2 (specific): Person X got enough sleep.

Conclusion: Therefore, Person X's cognitive performance improves.

But in the given text, only Premise 1 is present. So we need to fill in the missing Premise 2 and Conclusion. However, the problem says that we need to instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme. Since the text is only providing the general rule (the followed predicate), we need to see how the variables are structured. Let's look at the Effect to Cause scheme's structure again: [occured(A), followed(occured(A), occurs(B))], occurs(B). So in this structure, A is the cause, B is the effect. The example's computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). Here, A is the action of providing excellent service, B is the increase in satisfaction.

So applying this to the user's text: The general rule is "when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." This would correspond to followed(occured(A), occurs(B)), where A is "gets enough sleep" and B is "cognitive performance improves." But in the example, the action is structured as a predicate with arguments, like provides(company, excellent_customer_service). So for the user's text, A would be "gets_enough_sleep(X)" where X is a variable for someone. But in the computational form, how is this represented? Let's parse it.

The user's text: "Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves." In predicate logic, this can be represented as followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), occurs(improves(cognitive_performance(X))). But since variables need to be instantiated, perhaps in the actual case, X is a specific individual. However, the text doesn't mention a specific individual, which is part of the problem. The enthymeme is missing the specific case. So maybe the argument is presented in general terms, but the argumentation scheme requires a specific instance. Therefore, the user's text is incomplete, and we need to infer the missing parts. For example, if the argument were to be: "John got enough sleep. Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. Therefore, John's cognitive performance improves." Then the computational form would be [occured(gets_enough_sleep(john)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), occurs(improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], occurs(improves(cognitive_performance(john))). But the text only includes the general part. However, since the task is to translate the given argument into computational form by inferring the missing components, we need to see if the text provides enough to instantiate all variables. Alternatively, maybe the argument is presented as the general rule, which is the 'followed' premise, but without a specific occurrence. However, according to the Effect to Cause scheme's structure, both premises (occurrence and followed) are needed. Therefore, perhaps the user's text is just the 'followed' premise, and the missing parts are the occurrence and conclusion. But in that case, how can we instantiate variables? For example, maybe the argument is missing the specific occurrence, so in computational form, we'd have variables. But the problem states that variables must be instantiated. This is a bit confusing. Let's look back at the example. In the example, the premises are:

1. occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service))  specific instance
2. followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))  general rule

Conclusion: increases(company,customer_satisfaction)

In the user's text, the equivalent would be:

1. occured(gets_enough_sleep(person))  but this is missing in the text
2. followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))  given as the general statement

Conclusion: improves(cognitive_performance(person))  missing

But since the text only includes the general statement, perhaps the user intended that the argument is presented with the general rule as the only premise, but in reality, the argumentation scheme requires both premises. Therefore, the text is an enthymeme missing the specific premise and conclusion. However, the problem instructs to infer the missing components. So perhaps the intended argument is that someone (say, Alex) got enough sleep, so their cognitive performance improves. But since the text doesn't mention a specific person, maybe the variables remain as X. But the example in the context uses specific instances (like 'company'). Wait, but variables in the computational form in the examples are instantiated. For instance, in the example, 'company' is a specific entity, not a variable. So perhaps we need to create a specific instance here. However, the text doesn't mention a specific case. This is conflicting. Let me think again.

The problem states: "You must correctly identify to which argumentation scheme the presented argument belongs." The text provided is only the general rule. But according to the Effect to Cause scheme, the premises are the occurrence and the followed relation. So the text given is only the followed part. However, in the example, the natural language includes both the general rule and the specific occurrence. Therefore, maybe the user's text is missing the specific occurrence and conclusion. So to form the computational argument, we need to assume that there's a specific case where someone got enough sleep, leading to improved cognitive performance. But since the text doesn't mention a specific case, perhaps the variables are not instantiated. But the problem requires all variables and predicates to be instantiated. This suggests that the enthymeme is missing the specific instance, and we need to infer it. For example, the argument might be:

Premise 1: [General] When someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. (followed(...))

Premise 2: [Specific] Person X got enough sleep. (occured(...))

Conclusion: Therefore, Person X's cognitive performance improves.

But without knowing Person X, how do we instantiate? Maybe the argument is presented in a way that the specific case is implicit. Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of a larger argument where the specific case is mentioned elsewhere, but here it's missing. Since the task is to infer the missing components, perhaps we can use a placeholder for the person. But in the examples, they use specific terms like 'company' or 'john'. Alternatively, maybe the argument is in a general form, but that doesn't fit the scheme. Wait, looking at the example of the Effect to Cause scheme again, the first premise is the occurrence (specific) and the second is the followed (general). So perhaps in the user's case, the text is only providing the second premise (the followed part), and the first premise (the occurrence) and conclusion are missing. Therefore, to fill in the missing parts, we need to assume a specific occurrence. For instance, let's say the specific occurrence is 'Alex got enough sleep.' Then the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(alex))

But the problem is that the text doesn't mention Alex. So how can we infer that? Maybe the variables in the computational form can be more abstract. Wait, in the example, the followed predicate is written as followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction)). Here, the first argument to followed is the occurred event, and the second is the effect. But in the user's case, the followed would be followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X))). But variables like X are not instantiated. However, in the example, all variables are instantiated (company, etc.). Therefore, to match the example's format, we need to have specific instances. This suggests that the user's enthymeme is missing a specific occurrence, so we need to create a specific instance. But how? Since the text doesn't mention any specific person, maybe the argument is intended to be in a general form, but the argumentation scheme requires specific instances. This is a contradiction. Alternatively, perhaps the text is the general rule, and the argument is that whenever someone gets enough sleep (A occurs), their performance improves (B occurs). But that would be a universally quantified statement, which may not fit the Effect to Cause scheme as per the examples. 

Alternatively, maybe the argumentation scheme is not Effect to Cause but another one. Let's check other schemes. For example, the Necessary Condition scheme: [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). But the text doesn't mention goals or necessary conditions. The Moral Justification Ad Populum: involves everybody who is Y accepts P, and X's goal is Y. Not relevant here. Position to Know: involves someone's position to know and assertions. Not matching. Classification Argumentation scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, eagles are birds, white eagles are eagles, so white eagles are birds. Doesn't fit. The given text is about a causal relationship, not classification. 

The Effect to Cause seems the best fit. So perhaps the user's text is missing the specific occurrence. But how to handle variables. Let's assume that the specific occurrence is implied but not stated. For example, if the argument is presented as: 

"Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. Therefore, if Alex gets enough sleep, his cognitive performance will improve." 

But again, Alex is not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the argument is missing the application of the general rule. However, the computational form requires instantiated variables. If the text only provides the general rule, perhaps the computational form would use a universally quantified variable, but the examples don't show that. 

Wait, looking back at the Effect to Cause example's computational form: [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). Here, 'company' is a specific entity. So in the user's case, the 'someone' in the general statement would need to be instantiated to a specific person. But since the text doesn't provide that, maybe the argument is incomplete. However, the task is to infer the missing components. Therefore, we need to create a specific instance. For example, suppose the argument is: 

Premise 1: Generally, when someone (e.g., John) gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. 

Premise 2: John got enough sleep. 

Conclusion: Therefore, John's cognitive performance improves. 

But since the text only states the general premise, the other premise and conclusion are missing. So the enthymeme is missing those parts. To translate into the computational form, we need to instantiate the variables. Let's say the specific person is 'person_1'. Then the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(person_1)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(person_1))

But the problem is that the text doesn't mention 'person_1'. However, the problem instructs to infer missing components. So we need to assume that there's a specific instance where A occurred. But how? Maybe the enthymeme is structured as:

"Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. [Missing: John got enough sleep.] Therefore, [Missing: John's cognitive performance improves.]"

In this case, the computational form would include the specific occurrence and conclusion. Therefore, the answer would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(john)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(john))

But 'john' isn't mentioned in the original text. So this might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is presented in a general form, using variables, but according to the examples, variables are instantiated. This is conflicting. 

Wait, maybe the original text is the entire premise, and the conclusion is implicit. For example, the argument is that whenever someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. Therefore, in any specific case where someone gets enough sleep, their performance improves. But the computational form for Effect to Cause requires specific instances. If the text is only the general rule, then perhaps it's not an instance of the Effect to Cause scheme but another scheme. 

Alternatively, perhaps the argumentation scheme here is the Necessary Condition. Let's check. The Necessary Condition scheme is [goal(Sn), necessary_condition(Sn, Si)], is_necessary(Si). The example is about pursuing advancements requiring investing in solar power. The user's text isn't about goals or necessary conditions. So probably not. 

Another possibility is the Moral Justification Ad Populum, but that involves everybody who is Y accepts P, and someone's goal being Y. Doesn't fit. 

The Position to Know scheme involves someone in a position to know asserting something. Not applicable here. 

The Classification scheme involves classification hierarchies. Not relevant. 

The Effect to Cause seems the only possible fit. Therefore, despite the missing components, we have to assume that the specific occurrence and conclusion are part of the argument, even if they're not stated. So to instantiate, maybe we use a generic individual. Let's choose a placeholder like 'person_1'. But the examples use specific names like 'john' or 'company'. So perhaps we should use 'person' as the individual. 

Wait, the original text uses "someone" and "their", so maybe the individual is represented as a variable, but in the computational form, variables need to be instantiated. Alternatively, the argument is general, and the scheme allows for variables. But in the example, variables are instantiated. For example, in the Effect to Cause example, the company is a specific entity, not a variable. Therefore, perhaps we need to create a specific instance. But since the text doesn't provide one, we might have to use a generic term like 'individual' or 'person'. For example:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(individual)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(individual))

But the example uses specific terms, not variables. This is a problem. Maybe the user's text is intended to be a general rule, but the argumentation scheme requires specific instances, which are missing. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is to recognize that the argument is of the Effect to Cause type, and the missing components are the specific occurrence and conclusion, but we can't instantiate them. However, the problem requires us to fully instantiate all variables and predicates. 

Wait, maybe the text provided is the general premise, and the other premise and conclusion are missing, but we can infer them by assuming a hypothetical case. For example, if we take the general statement as the 'followed' premise, and assume that the specific occurrence is 'person_1 gets enough sleep', then the conclusion would be 'person_1's cognitive performance improves'. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(person_1)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(person_1))

But how to handle the variable X here. In the example, the 'followed' predicate uses the same entity (company) in both the occurred event and the effect. In the user's case, the followed predicate would need to relate the occurrence of getting enough sleep (for any X) to improved cognitive performance (for X). Therefore, in the computational form, the 'followed' part would need to have a universal aspect, but the example doesn't use variables. Instead, the example uses specific entities. This suggests that the Effect to Cause scheme in the examples doesn't handle variables but specific instances. Therefore, the user's text, being a general statement, doesn't fit unless there's a specific case. Since the text is an enthymeme, the missing part is the specific case and the conclusion. Therefore, the user's argument must be missing those, and we need to infer them. 

Given that the problem requires us to instantiate all variables and predicates, we have to create specific terms. Let's assume that the specific case is 'alex' as the person. Therefore:

Premise 1: occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex))

Premise 2: followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))

Conclusion: improves(cognitive_performance(alex))

But the second premise still has a variable X. However, in the example, the 'followed' predicate is between specific events. For instance, the occurrence of the company providing service is followed by the company's satisfaction increasing. The 'followed' predicate in the example is between two specific events involving the same company. Therefore, in the user's case, if we have a specific person, the 'followed' predicate would need to link the occurrence of that person's sleep to their performance improvement. So the 'followed' predicate would be: followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), improves(cognitive_performance(alex)))

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), improves(cognitive_performance(alex)))], improves(cognitive_performance(alex))

But in this case, the second premise is not a general rule but a specific instance. This contradicts the original text, which is a general rule. The example in the context has the followed predicate as a general rule: providing excellent service (by any company?) is followed by increased satisfaction. Wait, nothe example's computational form is [occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), followed(occured(provides(company,excellent_customer_service)), increases(company,customer_satisfaction))], increases(company,customer_satisfaction). Here, the 'followed' predicate is between the specific occurrence of the company providing service and the company's satisfaction increasing. But in reality, this is a general rule. So maybe the followed predicate in the computational form is representing the general rule, but using specific terms. That's confusing. Perhaps the way to model a general rule in the computational form is by having the followed predicate's first argument be a universally quantified event, but the example uses a specific company. This suggests that the computational form may not be handling general rules properly, but the example does include the general rule as part of the followed predicate. 

In any case, the user's text is the general rule, which corresponds to the 'followed' premise. To form the argument, we need a specific occurrence. Since the text doesn't provide it, we must infer it. Assuming that there's a specific person, let's say 'person', who got enough sleep. Then the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(person)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(person))

But again, the variable X here is a problem because in the example, the 'followed' predicate uses the same specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to represent the general rule as a followed predicate that applies universally, but the computational form in the example doesn't use variables. This is a bit of a paradox. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is considered as the 'followed' premise alone, but in the computational form, the specific occurrence is not needed. However, the Effect to Cause scheme requires both premises. Therefore, perhaps the user's text is incomplete, and the correct answer is to identify it as an instance of the Effect to Cause scheme, but with placeholders. However, the problem states that variables must be instantiated. 

Given all this confusion, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the text is the general rule (the followed premise), and the missing parts are the specific occurrence and conclusion. To instantiate, we can use a generic individual, say 'individual'. Therefore:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(individual)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(individual)), improves(cognitive_performance(individual)))], improves(cognitive_performance(individual))

But this makes the followed predicate specific to the individual, which might not capture the general rule. The example's followed predicate in the computational form is between the specific event and the specific effect. But the general rule is represented as a specific followed predicate. This seems inconsistent, but given the example, that's how it's done. 

Alternatively, maybe the followed predicate in the computational form represents the general rule by using a universally quantified variable. But the example doesn't do that. In the example, it's a specific company and specific customer satisfaction. Therefore, the user's text must be part of an argument where the specific occurrence is mentioned elsewhere, but here it's missing. So the computational form would be missing those parts. But the problem requires us to infer them. 

Perhaps the answer is:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(X)), improves(cognitive_performance(X)))], improves(cognitive_performance(X))

But variables are not instantiated. The problem says to instantiate all variables and predicates. Therefore, this approach is invalid. 

Given the example, the followed predicate links the specific occurrence to the effect. Therefore, the user's text's general rule must be represented as a followed predicate between the specific occurrence and effect. But without a specific occurrence, this isn't possible. Therefore, the argument as presented in the text is incomplete and cannot be fully instantiated. However, the problem instructs us to infer the missing components. Therefore, we must create a specific instance. Let's assume the argument is:

"Generally, when someone gets enough sleep, their cognitive performance improves. Alex got enough sleep. Therefore, Alex's cognitive performance improves."

Then the computational form would be:

[occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), followed(occured(gets_enough_sleep(alex)), improves(cognitive_performance(alex)))], improves(cognitive_performance(alex))

But the text only provides the second premise (the followed part). Therefore, this is the best possible answer, assuming the missing parts are inferred.
