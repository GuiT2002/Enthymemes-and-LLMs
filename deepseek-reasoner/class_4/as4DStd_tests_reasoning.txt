Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the user's request. They provided an enthymeme (an argument where parts are missing) and want me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

The text given is: "In our team meeting, Sarah insisted that no manager should resort to micromanagement, yet she readily defended her own supervisor’s habit of scrutinizing every minor detail."

Looking at the context examples, the user mentioned several argumentation schemes. The task is to determine which scheme this argument fits into. Let's go through the possible schemes.

The example provided in the Double Standard scheme involves Julia applying different standards to others versus herself. The structure here is someone (X) adopts two different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to the conclusion that X is using a double standard.

Comparing the given text: Sarah insists managers shouldn't micromanage but defends her supervisor's detailed scrutiny. This seems like a double standard because she's applying different standards to others (managers) versus her supervisor. 

So, the scheme here would be Double Standard. The variables would be X = sarah, P1 = "no manager should resort to micromanagement", A = "manager", P2 = "defends her own supervisor’s habit...", B = "supervisor’s habit". The situations are similar (both involve management styles) but she's adopting different opinions towards them. Therefore, the predicates would involve adopt(sarah, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(sarah, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A, B), leading to is_using_double_standard(sarah).

Now, need to instantiate all variables and predicates correctly. The original example uses quotes for the opinions and the subjects. Here, Sarah's two adopted opinions are "no manager should micromanage" and "defends supervisor's scrutiny". The contexts are "manager" vs. "supervisor’s habit". Wait, but in the example, the similar things are "professional book criticism" and "her own review". Here, maybe the similar contexts are "manager" and "supervisor’s habit of scrutinizing". But perhaps the subjects are "managers" and "her own supervisor's actions". The key is that the situations (A and B) are similar, but the opinions (P1 and P2) are different.

So, the computational form should be:

[adopt(sarah, opinion_respected_to("no manager should resort to micromanagement", "managers")), adopt(sarah, opinion_respected_to("defends her own supervisor’s habit of scrutinizing every minor detail", "supervisor's actions")), is_different("no manager should resort to micromanagement", "defends her own supervisor’s habit of scrutinizing every minor detail"), is_similar("managers", "supervisor's actions")], is_using_double_standard(sarah)

But I need to make sure the terms are correctly placed. The first opinion is P1 applied to A, the second opinion P2 applied to B. The problem is that the actual A and B need to be the situations. In the example, it's "professional book criticism" vs. "her own review". Here, maybe "managers" vs. "supervisor's actions". However, the supervisor is also a manager, so perhaps the situations are similar. The key is that Sarah is applying different standards to similar cases. Thus, A and B are the roles or contexts where the opinions are applied. So, perhaps A is "managers in general" and B is "supervisors (as managers)". So the similar contexts are both management roles. The opinions are P1: shouldn't micromanage, P2: defends detailed scrutiny (which is a form of micromanagement). Therefore, the opinions are different (P1 vs. P2) while the contexts (A and B) are similar. Hence, the computational form matches the Double Standard scheme.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking. They provided an enthymeme (an argument with a missing premise or conclusion) and want me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. The final answer must be in the specified format without any extra text.

The text given is: "Over dinner, Mark argued that enforcing strict bedtimes on children was unfair when applied to others, but he was adamant that his own kids adhere to a rigid schedule."

Looking at the context examples, I need to identify which argumentation scheme this fits. Let's review the schemes:

1. **Analogy based on Classification**: Involves features and classification. Doesn't seem to fit here.
2. **Effect to Cause**: Talks about events leading to others. Not this case.
3. **Need for Help**: Involves actions that help someone. Doesn't match.
4. **Argument from Opposites**: Uses opposites of properties. Not relevant here.
5. **Moral Justification Ad Populum**: About what everyone who is Y does. Not this.
6. **Classification**: Hierarchical classification. Not exactly.
7. **Necessary Condition**: Goals and necessary conditions. No.
8. **Position to Know**: Authority figures asserting claims. Not related.
9. **Double Standard**: Applying different standards to similar situations. Ah, this seems possible. Mark is applying different standards to others vs. his own kids.
10. **Vagueness of Verbal Classification**: Involves vague properties in a context. Doesn't fit.

The Double Standard scheme requires that someone adopts different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to a double standard. The example given in the context is about Julia demanding impartiality from others but not herself. Similarly, Mark says strict bedtimes are unfair for others but insists on them for his own kids. 

So, the variables would be:
- X = mark
- P1 = "enforcing strict bedtimes is unfair" (applied to others)
- P2 = "must adhere to rigid schedule" (applied to his own kids)
- A = "others' children"
- B = "his own kids"

But the scheme's predicates are: adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A, B). Then conclude is_using_double_standard(X).

Translating the text into these predicates:
- Mark adopts the opinion that enforcing strict bedtimes (P1) is unfair when applied to others (A).
- He also adopts the opinion that a rigid schedule (P2) is necessary for his own kids (B).
- P1 and P2 are different opinions (is_different).
- The situations (A and B) are similar (both about children's bedtimes), so is_similar.

Therefore, the computational form should be:

[adopt(mark, opinion_respected_to("enforcing strict bedtimes is unfair", "others' children")), adopt(mark, opinion_respected_to("adamant about rigid schedule", "his own kids")), is_different("enforcing strict bedtimes is unfair", "adamant about rigid schedule"), is_similar("others' children", "his own kids")], is_using_double_standard(mark)

Checking the example provided in the context for Double Standard, the structure matches. The predicates use quoted strings for the opinions and the situations. The conclusion is the double standard applied to the person (mark in this case). The key is ensuring that P1 and P2 are different opinions and that A and B are similar situations. Here, others' children vs. his own kids are similar contexts (both involve children's bedtime rules), but the opinions applied are different (unfair vs. necessary). So, this fits the Double Standard scheme perfectly.


Okay, let's break this down. The user provided an argument that's an enthymeme, meaning part of it is missing. I need to figure out which argumentation scheme it fits into from the given context. The example schemes include things like analogy, cause-effect, moral justification, double standard, etc.

The text is about Emily condemning plagiarism in her peers' work but ignoring similar issues in her own. So, she's applying different standards to others versus herself. That immediately makes me think of the Double Standard Argumentation scheme. 

Looking at the example for double standard: Julia demands strict impartiality from others but dismisses it when her own review is questioned. The scheme requires four premises: adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1,A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2,B)), is_different(P1,P2), is_similar(A,B). The conclusion is is_using_double_standard(X).

In Emily's case, she adopts the opinion that condemns plagiarism (P1) when it's her peers' work (A), but adopts a different opinion (P2) turning a blind eye (B) when it's her own work. The actions (condemning vs. ignoring) are different, but the situations (peers' assignments and her own work) are similar in being academic work. So, mapping these variables:

X is emily. P1 is condemning plagiarism, A is peers’ assignments. P2 is turning a blind eye (ignoring), B is her own work. The contexts (A and B) are similar because both involve academic ethics and plagiarism. The opinions (P1 and P2) are different standards. Therefore, this fits the Double Standard scheme. 

Now, I need to instantiate all the variables and predicates exactly as per the scheme. The predicates are adopt, is_different, is_similar, and the conclusion is_using_double_standard. 

Checking the example again, the predicates use quotes around the opinions and contexts. So for Emily, it should be adopt(emily, opinion_respected_to("condemns plagiarism", "peers’ assignments")) and adopt(emily, opinion_respected_to("turns blind eye", "her own work")). Then is_different between the two opinions and is_similar between the contexts. 

I need to make sure the predicates are in the correct order and the terms are properly quoted. The final computational form should match the scheme structure exactly.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to understand the text: Daniel criticizes cutting corners on quality for client projects but justifies using shortcuts for his own assignments. This seems like he's applying different standards to similar situations. 

Looking at the argumentation schemes, the Double Standard one fits here. The example given in the context involves someone demanding impartiality from others but dismissing it for themselves. The structure requires adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A,B)), leading to is_using_double_standard(X).

Variables to instantiate: X is Daniel. P1 is the opinion of criticizing cutting corners (strict standards), and P2 is justifying shortcuts (lenient standards). A and B are the contexts—client projects vs. his own assignments. They are different opinions (P1 and P2) but similar situations (A and B). So the premises would be Daniel adopting both opinions in similar contexts, hence the double standard.

I need to make sure the predicates match the scheme exactly. The conclusion should be is_using_double_standard(daniel). Checking the example again, yes, the format aligns. So the final answer should list the four premises and the conclusion.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an argument in natural language and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme the text belongs to. The text is about Linda complaining about colleagues overusing technology in meetings but excusing her own phone-checking. This seems like a case where someone applies different standards to others than to themselves, which is a classic double standard scenario.

Looking at the context examples, the Double Standard Argumentation scheme matches this situation. The example given was Julia demanding strict impartiality from critics but dismissing bias in her own review. The structure here involves adopting different opinions (P1 and P2) in similar situations (A and B), leading to a double standard.

Now, I need to instantiate the variables and predicates. The scheme requires four premises: adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), and is_similar(A, B)), concluding is_using_double_standard(X).

Breaking down the text: Linda (X) complains about colleagues overusing tech (P1 applied to A: colleagues' meetings), but excuses her own phone use (P2 applied to B: her own meetings). The opinions P1 and P2 are different ("complain about overuse" vs. "excuse her own"), and the situations A and B are similar (both involve technology use in meetings).

So the variables would be:
- X: linda
- P1: "complain about overuse of technology"
- A: "colleagues during meetings"
- P2: "excuse her own phone-checking"
- B: "her own meetings"

Checking the structure, the predicates would be adopt(linda, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(linda, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A, B). The conclusion is is_using_double_standard(linda).

I need to ensure the predicates are formatted correctly, using the exact terms from the text. Also, the premises and conclusion must align with the scheme's structure. Let me verify each part against the example provided in the context. The example had "demands strict impartiality" and "dismisses bias concerns" as P1 and P2, which are different, and similar situations ("professional book criticism" vs. "her own review"). Here, Linda's actions mirror that structure. Therefore, the computational form should follow the Double Standard scheme.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme and a set of argumentation schemes with examples. The task is to identify which scheme the text belongs to, instantiate all variables and predicates, and present the computational form without any extra text.

First, let's parse the given text: "While discussing personal integrity, Alex decried lying in intimate relationships, yet he dismissed similar deceptions in his business dealings." The key points here are that Alex condemns lying in one context (intimate relationships) but dismisses similar deceptions in another (business dealings). This looks like a case of applying different standards to similar situations.

Looking at the argumentation schemes provided, the Double Standard scheme seems relevant. The example given for that scheme involves Julia applying different standards to professional critics and her own reviews. Similarly, Alex is holding different opinions on similar actions (lying in different contexts). 

The Double Standard scheme requires four premises: adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), and is_similar(A,B). The conclusion is is_using_double_standard(X).

Breaking down the text: Alex (X) adopts an opinion where he decries lying (P1) in intimate relationships (A), and dismisses deceptions (P2) in business dealings (B). The actions (lying and deceptions) are similar (A and B are similar), but his opinions (P1 and P2) are different. Thus, he's applying a double standard.

Now, mapping the variables: X is alex. P1 is "decrying lying", A is "intimate relationships". P2 is "dismissing deceptions", B is "business dealings". The predicates would be adopt(alex, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(alex, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A, B). The conclusion is is_using_double_standard(alex).

Need to make sure that the terms are correctly instantiated. The example used "demands strict impartiality" and "dismisses bias concerns" as P1 and P2, which are different. Here, "decried lying" vs. "dismissed similar deceptions" are different opinions (P1 and P2). The contexts (intimate relationships and business dealings) are similar in that both involve ethical standards, making them similar enough for the double standard. 

Check if all variables are filled correctly. The scheme's structure should match: [adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1,A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2,B)), is_different(P1,P2), is_similar(A,B)], conclusion is_using_double_standard(X).

So the computational form would be:

[adopt(alex, opinion_respected_to("decried lying", "intimate relationships")), adopt(alex, opinion_respected_to("dismissed similar deceptions", "business dealings")), is_different("decried lying", "dismissed similar deceptions"), is_similar("intimate relationships", "business dealings")], is_using_double_standard(alex)

I need to ensure that the predicates are exactly as per the scheme, using the correct terms. The phrases in quotes are the specific opinions and contexts from the text. The conclusion is correctly instantiated with 'alex' as X.


Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an argument in natural language and wants it translated into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context given.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme the text belongs to. The example context lists several schemes like Analogy, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, etc. The text given is about Michael holding large corporations accountable for waste management but dismissing personal accountability in household recycling. 

This seems like a case of applying different standards to similar situations. Looking at the schemes, the Double Standard one fits here. The Double Standard scheme involves adopting different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to the conclusion that the person is using a double standard.

In the example provided for Double Standard, Julia demands strict impartiality from critics but dismisses concerns about her own review. Similarly, Michael is strict with corporations but lenient with personal responsibility. 

Breaking down the text: Michael adopts the opinion that corporations must be held accountable (P1 applied to A), and he dismisses personal accountability (P2 applied to B). The situations are similar (both about accountability in waste management), but the standards are different. 

Variables to instantiate: X is Michael. P1 is "must be held accountable for waste management", A is "large corporations". P2 is "brushed aside calls for personal accountability", B is "household recycling". So, the premises would be Michael adopting opinion P1 for A and P2 for B, P1 and P2 are different, and A and B are similar (both environmental responsibility contexts).

The computational form should follow the Double Standard scheme's structure: [adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A,B)], is_using_double_standard(X).

Need to ensure variables are correctly substituted. Check if the predicates match. The conclusion is that Michael is using a double standard. All elements are present in the text. Therefore, the answer should be the instantiated version of the Double Standard scheme.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to translate the given natural language argument into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the provided context. The text given is: "During a neighborhood meeting, Rachel lambasted residents for hosting noisy late-night parties, but she didn’t see an issue when similar disruptions came from her own home."

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme this fits into. Let's review the schemes provided.

The example given in the context for the Double Standard scheme is when someone applies different standards to similar situations. In the example, Julia demands strict impartiality from others but dismisses concerns about her own review. The structure here is adopting two different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to the conclusion of a double standard.

Looking at the text: Rachel criticizes others for noisy parties but doesn't see a problem when she does the same. This seems like a classic double standard. She adopts a strict opinion towards others (hosting noisy parties) but a lenient one towards herself, even though the situations are similar (both involve noisy disruptions). 

Now, mapping this to the Double Standard Argumentation scheme:
- The scheme requires four premises and a conclusion. The premises are:
  1. adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A))
  2. adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B))
  3. is_different(P1, P2)
  4. is_similar(A, B)
  Conclusion: is_using_double_standard(X)

In the example, X is Julia. For our case, X is Rachel. The opinions P1 and P2 are the differing standards she applies. The situations A and B are the contexts where these opinions are applied. 

Breaking down the text:
- Rachel lambasted residents for noisy parties (P1: strict against others' parties, A: others' actions)
- She didn't see an issue when similar disruptions came from her home (P2: lenient towards her own parties, B: her own actions)
- P1 and P2 are different (strict vs. lenient)
- A and B are similar (both involve noisy parties, just different actors)

So, substituting variables:
- X = rachel
- P1 = "lambasts residents for noisy parties"  perhaps "condemns noisy parties"
- A = "residents' parties"
- P2 = "does not see issue with similar disruptions from her home"  "excuses own noisy parties"
- B = "her own parties"
- Check if P1 and P2 are different (they are: condemning vs. excusing)
- Check if A and B are similar (both are noisy disruptions/parties)

Therefore, the premises would be:
adopt(rachel, opinion_respected_to("condemns noisy parties", "residents' parties")),
adopt(rachel, opinion_respected_to("excuses own noisy parties", "her own parties")),
is_different("condemns noisy parties", "excuses own noisy parties"),
is_similar("residents' parties", "her own parties")

Conclusion: is_using_double_standard(rachel)

I need to ensure that the predicates match the structure exactly. The example uses "demands strict impartiality" and "dismisses bias concerns" for P1 and P2, and "professional book criticism" vs. "her own review" for A and B. So in our case, P1 is the strict opinion applied to others, P2 is the lenient one applied to herself. The situations (A and B) are the targets of these opinions.

Thus, the computational form should correctly instantiate all variables and predicates according to the Double Standard scheme.


Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to identify the correct argumentation scheme for the given text and then represent it computationally based on the context examples provided.

First, the text is: "At the gym, Tom insisted that everyone should stick to a disciplined workout routine, yet he openly flouted the same regimen for himself." 

Looking at the context examples, there are several argumentation schemes. Let me go through each one to see which fits.

The example given here seems to involve Tom applying different standards to others and himself. The key part is that he insists others follow a regimen but doesn't follow it himself. This reminds me of the Double Standard argumentation scheme. 

Looking at the Double Standard example in the context: Julia demands impartiality from critics but dismisses bias in her own review. The structure here is someone adopting two different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to a double standard.

In the text, Tom is adopting the opinion that everyone should stick to the regimen (P1 applies to others), but he doesn't follow it himself (P2 applies to him). The situations (applying the regimen to others vs. himself) are similar, but the opinions (insisting vs. flouting) are different. So this fits the Double Standard scheme.

Now, mapping the text to the scheme's variables. The scheme is: [adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2), is_similar(A,B)], is_using_double_standard(X).

Variables to instantiate:
- X is Tom.
- P1 is "insisted that everyone should stick to a disciplined workout routine" which can be phrased as "demands disciplined routine adherence".
- P2 is "openly flouted the same regimen for himself" which can be phrased as "flouts regimen for self".
- A is the situation where it's applied to others (general case), so maybe "others' workout routines".
- B is the situation applied to himself, "his own workout routine". These are similar since both are about workout regimens.

So, the predicates would be:
adopt(tom, opinion_respected_to("demands disciplined routine adherence", "others' workout routines")),
adopt(tom, opinion_respected_to("flouts regimen for self", "his own workout routine")),
is_different("demands disciplined routine adherence", "flouts regimen for self"),
is_similar("others' workout routines", "his own workout routine").

Then the conclusion is is_using_double_standard(tom).

I need to make sure that the predicates match the structure exactly. The opinions (P1, P2) are different, and the situations (A, B) are similar. The example used "professional book criticism" vs. "her own review" as similar, so here "others' workout" vs. "his own workout" should be similar. The opinions are "demands strict impartiality" vs. "dismisses bias concerns" in the example, which map to Tom's case as demanding adherence vs. flouting.

So putting it all together, the computational form should be the list of premises followed by the conclusion, each predicate correctly instantiated.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an argument in natural language and expects me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context given.

First, I need to understand the text. The example given is about Lisa condemning aggressive marketing tactics by competitors but defending their use in her own campaigns. The key here is that she's applying different standards to similar situations. 

Looking at the context provided, there are several argumentation schemes. Let's go through them to see which fits.

The example talks about Lisa's contradictory behavior. The Double Standard scheme seems relevant here. The Double Standard example given earlier was when Julia demands strict impartiality from others but dismisses concerns about her own reviews. The structure involves adopting different opinions (P1 and P2) towards similar situations (A and B), leading to a double standard.

In Lisa's case, she condemns competitors using aggressive tactics (P1 applied to A) but defends her own use (P2 applied to B). The situations (competitors' tactics vs. her own campaigns) are similar, but she applies different opinions (condemn vs. defend). This matches the Double Standard scheme.

Now, mapping the variables:

- X is Lisa.
- P1 is "condemn aggressive marketing tactics".
- A is "used by competitors".
- P2 is "defend employing the same strategies".
- B is "in her own campaigns".

So, the predicates would be:

- adopt(lisa, opinion_respected_to("condemn aggressive marketing tactics", "used by competitors"))
- adopt(lisa, opinion_respected_to("defend employing the same strategies", "in her own campaigns"))
- is_different between the two opinions.
- is_similar between the two situations (competitors' use vs. her own).

Therefore, the computational form should follow the Double Standard structure as in the example, with variables instantiated accordingly.
