Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme, which is an argument where either the conclusion or one of the premises is missing. My task is to translate this natural language argument into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme the given text belongs to. The text is: "Joseph says that exercising is healthy." 

Looking at the context examples, there are several schemes like Analogy based on Classification, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Argument from Opposites, Moral Justification Ad Populum, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness of a Verbal Classification.

The key here is Joseph making a statement. That makes me think of the Position to Know argumentation scheme. The example given for that scheme involves Daniel, a meteorologist, asserting something about weather, and then the conclusion is that his assertion is correct because of his position. 

So, applying that to Joseph: Joseph is in a position to know about health matters (maybe he's a doctor, a fitness expert, etc.), he asserts that exercising is healthy, and the subject (health) contains his assertion. Therefore, the conclusion would be that exercising is healthy.

But wait, the original text doesn't explicitly state Joseph's position. However, in enthymemes, sometimes premises are missing. The user might be implying that Joseph's position gives authority to his statement. So the missing premises could be that Joseph is in a position to know (like a health expert), he makes the assertion, and the subject (health) contains that assertion. The conclusion would then be the assertion itself.

Checking the Position to Know scheme structure: [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], Ar.

Variables here would be A=Joseph, S=health (or the relevant field), Ar=exercising_is_healthy. So the computational form would have:

position_to_know(joseph, health), asserts(joseph, exercising_is_healthy), contain(health, exercising_is_healthy)], exercising_is_healthy.

But wait, the original text says "Joseph says that exercising is healthy." The conclusion isn't stated, but in the example, the conclusion is the assertion itself. So the enthymeme here is missing the conclusion that exercising is healthy, but in the given text, the conclusion is actually present as Joseph's statement. Wait, no—the example's conclusion is the assertion being accepted as true because of the position. In the user's text, the statement is presented as a fact because Joseph says it. So the structure is: because Joseph is in a position to know about health, and he asserts exercising is healthy, and health contains that assertion, therefore exercising is healthy.

So the premises would be:

1. position_to_know(joseph, S) – S is the subject, which is health or a related field.

2. asserts(joseph, exercising_is_healthy)

3. contain(S, exercising_is_healthy)

Conclusion: exercising_is_healthy.

But the original text only states "Joseph says that exercising is healthy." The other premises (his position and the subject containing the assertion) are missing. So in the computational form, we need to instantiate all variables and predicates. The user's example for Position to Know uses 'meteorology' as the subject S. So here, maybe S is 'health' or 'exercise_science'.

Thus, the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(joseph, health), asserts(joseph, exercising_is_healthy), contain(health, exercising_is_healthy)], exercising_is_healthy.

But I need to make sure that the predicates are correctly instantiated. The variables in the Position to Know scheme are A, S, Ar. Here, A is Joseph, S is health (or the relevant field), Ar is exercising_is_healthy. The 'contain' predicate checks if the subject S contains the assertion Ar.

So, the final answer should be:

Final answer: [position_to_know(joseph,health),asserts(joseph,exercising_is_healthy),contain(health,exercising_is_healthy)],exercising_is_healthy

But wait, maybe the subject S isn't explicitly mentioned. However, in the example, the subject is 'meteorology', which is the field. So in Joseph's case, the subject would be his area of expertise. Since the text doesn't specify, we have to infer. Maybe 'health_advice' or similar. Alternatively, perhaps 'health' is acceptable. The key is that the subject S must be such that Joseph is in a position to know about S, and S contains the assertion. Since exercising being healthy is part of health knowledge, 'health' as S makes sense.

Therefore, the computational representation would be as above.


Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an enthymeme: "Maria is a mathematician." They want me to translate this into a computational form using the appropriate argumentation scheme from the context given.

First, I need to figure out which argumentation scheme applies here. Let me look through the examples provided in the context. The schemes include things like Analogy based on Classification, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Argument from Opposites, Moral Justification Ad Populum, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness of a Verbal Classification.

The sentence "Maria is a mathematician" seems like a simple classification. But the example for the Classification Argumentation Scheme is the one about eagles and birds. The structure there is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], which leads to be(A,G). So, for example, all eagles (F) are birds (G), and if something is a white eagle (A is F), then it's a bird (G). 

Wait, in the user's example, the premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). So the structure is: if F is classified as G, and A is an F, then A is a G. 

Now, looking at the given text: "Maria is a mathematician." But that's just a single statement. Since it's an enthymeme, there's likely a missing premise or conclusion. The conclusion might be something like "Therefore, Maria is a scientist" or similar, but the user hasn't provided that. Wait, maybe the original enthymeme is missing parts. The user's input is just "Maria is a mathematician." But in the context of the argumentation schemes, perhaps this is part of a larger argument where Maria's classification leads to another conclusion. But the example given in the Classification scheme is when you have two premises: a general classification and a specific instance, leading to a conclusion.

Wait, the example given is:

All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds.

So the premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). 

But the user's input here is "Maria is a mathematician." If that's the only premise, maybe the missing parts are the general classification and the conclusion. For example, if the argument is: All mathematicians are scientists. Maria is a mathematician. Therefore, Maria is a scientist. But the user only provided "Maria is a mathematician." So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the first premise (classification) and the conclusion. However, in the given text, only the premise "Maria is a mathematician" is present. So how to fit that into the scheme.

Wait, the user says that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing. So I need to infer the missing parts based on the argumentation scheme. The example for the Classification scheme is:

Premise1: classification(eagle, bird) [All eagles are birds]
Premise2: be(white_eagle, eagle) [White eagles are eagles]
Conclusion: be(white_eagle, bird) [Therefore, white eagles are birds]

But in the given text, we only have "Maria is a mathematician." So that's analogous to the premise2 in the example (be(white_eagle, eagle)). So what's missing is the first premise (classification(F, G)) and the conclusion (be(A, G)). 

But how to know what F and G are? The example uses "eagle" as F and "bird" as G. In the given text, if "Maria is a mathematician" is the premise2 (be(A, F)), then F is mathematician, and G would be something else. But the user's text doesn't provide the classification premise. So maybe the enthymeme is missing that. For instance, if the argument is: All mathematicians are logical. Maria is a mathematician. Therefore, Maria is logical. But the user only provided "Maria is a mathematician." So the enthymeme is missing the first premise and the conclusion.

But the task is to instantiate the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. The argumentation scheme for Classification is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], so the conclusion is be(A,G). The given text is "Maria is a mathematician," which would correspond to be(maria, mathematician). But to form the argument according to the scheme, we need the classification premise. However, since the text is an enthymeme, maybe the conclusion is missing. But the user hasn't provided it, so perhaps the user's text is the premise2 (be(A,F)), and the classification premise is missing, as well as the conclusion.

But how to infer the missing components? The example in the context uses "classification(eagle, bird)" and "be(white_eagle, eagle)" to conclude "be(white_eagle, bird)". So the variables are F (eagle), G (bird), A (white_eagle). 

In the user's case, the given premise is "Maria is a mathematician," which is be(maria, mathematician). So A is maria, F is mathematician. But what is G? To fill this in, we need to know the classification, which is missing. But the enthymeme might be missing the classification premise. For example, if the full argument is: All mathematicians are good at problem-solving. Maria is a mathematician. Therefore, Maria is good at problem-solving. But since only "Maria is a mathematician" is given, perhaps the classification premise is implicit. However, in the computational representation, we need to instantiate all parts of the scheme, including the missing ones. But how?

Wait, the user's instruction says: "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So even if the enthymeme is missing parts, we need to infer them. But how?

Looking at the example, the user's text is "Maria is a mathematician." To fit into the Classification scheme, we need two premises and a conclusion. The given text is one premise (be(A,F)), so we need to infer the classification premise (classification(F,G)) and the conclusion (be(A,G)). But how to infer F and G? Since the enthymeme is incomplete, perhaps F is "mathematician" and G is some superclass, like "scientist" or "logician". But how can we know?

Alternatively, maybe the argument is simply missing the conclusion. For example, if the argument is: Maria is a mathematician. All mathematicians are scientists. Therefore, Maria is a scientist. But the user only provided "Maria is a mathematician." So the missing premise is "All mathematicians are scientists" and the conclusion is "Maria is a scientist." But how to infer that from just "Maria is a mathematician"? It's unclear. But perhaps the user expects that the enthymeme is structured such that "Maria is a mathematician" is the premise2 (be(A,F)), and the classification premise (classification(F,G)) is missing, along with the conclusion. But since we have to instantiate all variables, perhaps we need to assume that the classification premise is classification(mathematician, G), and the conclusion is be(maria, G). But what is G?

Alternatively, maybe the example is different. Wait, in the Classification Argumentation Scheme example, the conclusion is that white eagles are birds. The user's text is "Maria is a mathematician." If we consider that as the premise2 (be(A,F)), then we need the classification premise (classification(F,G)), but we don't have that. So maybe the user's example is incomplete, and the answer should only use the given sentence, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but let's think again.

Wait, maybe the given text is the conclusion? But no, the example shows that the premises are classification and be, leading to the conclusion. So "Maria is a mathematician" can't be the conclusion. Alternatively, maybe the argument is that Maria is a mathematician, so Maria is a scientist (if mathematicians are scientists). But the given text only states the premise. But how can we know?

Alternatively, maybe the argumentation scheme is Position to Know. For example, if Maria is a mathematician (position to know), and she asserts something, then we can accept her assertion. But the text only says "Maria is a mathematician." So if the argument is: Maria is a mathematician (position to know), she asserts X, so X is true. But the given text doesn't mention an assertion. So that's not applicable.

Looking back at the Classification scheme: the structure is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], so conclusion is be(A,G). The user's text is "Maria is a mathematician." That's be(maria, mathematician). So this is the second premise. The first premise would be classification(mathematician, G), and the conclusion is be(maria, G). But G is missing. So we need to infer G. But how? Since the enthymeme is missing parts, perhaps G is inferred from context. For example, if mathematicians are considered scientists, then G is scientist. But the text doesn't state that. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that the classification premise is classification(mathematician, mathematician), but that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the argument is that Maria is a mathematician, therefore she is a person, but that's too trivial.

Wait, perhaps the given example is not exactly the same. In the example, they have two premises: classification and be. The user's text is only providing one. So maybe the answer is that the user's text is the be premise, and we need to infer the classification premise and the conclusion. But without additional information, we have to make an assumption. However, the problem states that the text belongs to exactly one argumentation scheme, and we need to instantiate all variables and predicates. So perhaps the answer is that the given text is the be(A,F) premise, and the classification premise and conclusion are missing. But how to represent that? The problem says to infer the missing components. So maybe the classification is something like classification(mathematician, expert_in_math), and the conclusion is be(maria, expert_in_math). But how to determine that? Alternatively, maybe the classification is classification(mathematician, person) but that's too obvious. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user's example is incomplete and the answer should follow the structure of the Classification scheme, with the given premise as be(A,F), and then we need to assume the classification premise. For example, if the argument is "All mathematicians are intelligent. Maria is a mathematician. Therefore, Maria is intelligent." Then the user's text is the second premise. So the computational form would be [classification(mathematician, intelligent), be(maria, mathematician)], be(maria, intelligent). But since the user's text doesn't mention "intelligent," how can we infer that? That's impossible without more context. 

Wait, but the problem says: "You must correctly identify to which argumentation scheme the presented argument belongs. The text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples." So the text "Maria is a mathematician" must fit into one of the schemes. Let's check the schemes again:

- Analogy based on Classification: Requires features and classified premises.

- Effect to Cause: Requires occured and followed.

- Need for Help: would_help, can_carry_out, not_too_costly.

- Argument from Opposites: has_property and is_opposite.

- Moral Justification Ad Populum: everybody_who_is and goal_of.

- Classification: classification(F,G), be(A,F), conclusion be(A,G).

- Necessary Condition: goal and necessary_condition.

- Position to Know: position_to_know, asserts, contain.

- Double Standard: adopt, is_different, is_similar.

- Vagueness of a Verbal Classification: has_property, vague_for, occurs_in.

The given text "Maria is a mathematician" is a simple statement of classification. The Classification scheme requires two premises: classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to be(A,G). If the user's text is "Maria is a mathematician," that's be(maria, mathematician). So the missing parts are classification(mathematician, G) and the conclusion be(maria, G). But without knowing G, how can we proceed?

Wait, maybe the user intended that "Maria is a mathematician" is the conclusion, and the premises are missing. But that doesn't fit the example. The example's conclusion is the third part. Alternatively, perhaps the argument is missing the classification premise, and the conclusion is the given statement. But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is using the Classification scheme but with the given statement as the conclusion. For example, if the premises are classification(scientist, mathematician) and be(maria, scientist), then the conclusion is be(maria, mathematician). But that's the reverse of the example. The example is classification(F,G), be(A,F)  be(A,G). So F is the subclass, G is the superclass. So if F is eagle and G is bird. So if the premises are classification(mathematician, scientist) and be(maria, mathematician), then the conclusion is be(maria, scientist). But the user's text is "Maria is a mathematician," which would be the premise be(A,F). So the conclusion would be be(maria, G), where G is the superclass. But the user's text doesn't provide the conclusion. 

Given that the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing, and we need to infer the missing parts, I think the intended answer is to recognize that the given text is the be(A,F) premise of the Classification scheme, and we need to infer the classification(F,G) premise and the conclusion. However, without explicit information about G, we have to make an assumption. But in the example, the classification is explicit (eagle to bird). So perhaps the answer expects that the classification premise is missing, and we just use variables. Wait, but in the computational representation, variables are instantiated. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects that the given text is part of the Classification scheme, but since the enthymeme is incomplete, we have to present the premises and conclusion as per the scheme, filling in the missing parts with placeholders. But the problem says to "infer the missing components". So perhaps the missing parts can be inferred from common knowledge. For instance, mathematicians are a type of scientist. So classification(mathematician, scientist). Then, since Maria is a mathematician, she is a scientist. But the user's text doesn't mention that. However, since the enthymeme is missing parts, we need to infer that. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is simply that Maria is a mathematician (be(maria, mathematician)) and since all mathematicians are classified as such (classification(mathematician, mathematician)), which is trivial, but that's not useful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that the given text is part of the Position to Know scheme. For example, Maria is a mathematician (position to know), and if she asserts something about mathematics, then that's true. But the user's text doesn't include an assertion. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is using the Necessary Condition scheme. For example, if Maria's goal is something, and being a mathematician is a necessary condition. But the text doesn't mention a goal. 

Wait, the example for the Classification scheme is:

Premise1: classification(eagle, bird)

Premise2: be(white_eagle, eagle)

Conclusion: be(white_eagle, bird)

Given that, the user's text "Maria is a mathematician" would be analogous to Premise2. So to complete the argument, we need Premise1: classification(mathematician, G) and Conclusion: be(maria, G). So the missing components are Premise1 and the Conclusion. But without knowing G, we have to infer it. The most logical G would be a superclass of mathematician, like 'scientist' or 'academic'. But how can we determine that?

The problem says to "infer the missing components". Since the enthymeme is "Maria is a mathematician," the intended conclusion is likely that Maria has some property that mathematicians have. For example, "Maria is a mathematician. All mathematicians are logical. Therefore, Maria is logical." But since the user hasn't provided the additional premises, we have to infer based on the structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is simply stating that Maria is a mathematician, and the classification premise is that mathematicians are people, leading to the conclusion that Maria is a person. But that's a trivial example.

Given the lack of explicit information, I think the intended answer is to recognize that the given statement fits the Classification scheme's second premise (be(A,F)), and the missing premise is classification(F,G), with the conclusion being be(A,G). Therefore, the computational representation should have all three parts, even if G is inferred. 

But to instantiate the variables, we need to assign concrete terms. Let's assume that the classification is from mathematician to person (though that's trivial). So:

classification(mathematician, person)

be(maria, mathematician)

Therefore, be(maria, person)

But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the classification is mathematician to academic. So:

classification(mathematician, academic)

be(maria, mathematician)

Therefore, be(maria, academic)

But again, this is an assumption. However, the problem requires us to infer the missing parts. Since the example uses a non-trivial classification (eagle to bird), perhaps the intended answer is similar, assuming that mathematician is classified under a broader category. 

Alternatively, maybe the classification is mathematician as a type of scientist. So:

classification(mathematician, scientist)

be(maria, mathematician)

Therefore, be(maria, scientist)

In that case, the computational representation would be:

[classification(mathematician,scientist),be(maria,mathematician)],be(maria,scientist)

But the user's text only provides "Maria is a mathematician," which is the second premise. The first premise and conclusion are missing. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so we must infer the missing parts. But without additional context, how can we know G? 

Perhaps the answer expects that the classification premise is classification(mathematician, mathematician), which is redundant, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the argument is that Maria is a mathematician, and mathematicians are humans, so Maria is a human. But again, without context, it's guesswork. 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "You must translate the given argument to a computational form, represented in the context below, by reasoning through the present argumentative sentences and then inferring the context of the rest of the argumentation scheme." So perhaps the answer should mirror the example but with the given terms. In the example, the structure is:

[classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G)

Given the text "Maria is a mathematician," that's be(A,F) where A is maria and F is mathematician. So we need to assume a classification(F,G). The example uses F as a subclass and G as the superclass. So F is mathematician, and G could be a superclass like 'scientist'. But the user's text doesn't provide that. So the answer must include variables for G. But the problem says to "Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates", so we can't leave variables. Therefore, we need to infer G.

But how? The only way is to assume that the argument is structured like the example, where the first premise is the classification, and the second is the specific case. So if the example is:

All eagles (F) are birds (G). White eagles (A) are eagles (F). Therefore, white eagles are birds (G).

Then for the user's case:

All mathematicians (F) are [G]. Maria (A) is a mathematician (F). Therefore, Maria is [G].

But since the user only provides "Maria is a mathematician," we need to infer G. The most logical inference is that the missing premise is classification(mathematician, G), and the conclusion is be(maria, G). Without additional information, G could be any superclass of mathematician. But since the example uses 'bird' as the superclass, maybe the intended answer uses 'scientist' as G. 

Thus, the computational representation would be:

[classification(mathematician,scientist),be(maria,mathematician)],be(maria,scientist)

But the user hasn't provided the classification premise. However, the problem says to infer the missing components. Therefore, even though the text only provides one premise, the computational form must include all premises and the conclusion according to the argumentation scheme. 

Therefore, the answer should include the classification premise and the conclusion, even if they are inferred. Since the example uses a classification from a specific to a general category, the user's case should do the same. So the conclusion is that Maria is a scientist (assuming the classification is mathematician to scientist), leading to the computational form as above.

But how can we be sure? The problem states that the text belongs to only one of the provided schemes. The Classification scheme fits here, as the example shows a similar structure. Therefore, the answer must use the Classification scheme, inferring the missing classification premise and the conclusion.

Another possibility is that the given text is the conclusion, but that doesn't align with the example. The example's conclusion is the third part. So the given text must be one of the premises. The example's premises are two, so the user's text is one premise, and the other is missing. 

Given all this, the computational form should be:

[classification(mathematician, G), be(maria, mathematician)], be(maria, G)

But the problem requires instantiating all variables. Therefore, G must be a concrete term. Since the example uses 'bird', which is a category, perhaps the answer uses 'expert_in_math' or 'scientist'. But without explicit context, it's hard to tell. However, in the example, 'eagle' is a subclass of 'bird'. Similarly, 'mathematician' could be a subclass of 'scientist'. 

Assuming that, the instantiated form would be:

[classification(mathematician, scientist), be(maria, mathematician)], be(maria, scientist)

This matches the structure of the example, replacing F with mathematician, G with scientist, and A with maria. Therefore, the answer should be this.


Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to take the given argument in natural language, which is an enthymeme (meaning it might be missing a premise or conclusion), and translate it into the correct computational form based on the provided context of argumentation schemes.

First, let me look at the text provided: "Emily asserts that all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria." The user mentioned that this is an enthymeme, so parts might be missing. I need to identify which argumentation scheme this fits into from the examples given in the context.

Looking at the list of argumentation schemes in the context:

1. **Analogy based on Classification**
2. **Effect to Cause**
3. **Need for Help**
4. **Argument from Opposites**
5. **Moral Justification Ad Populum**
6. **Classification**
7. **Necessary Condition**
8. **Position to Know**
9. **Double Standard**
10. **Vagueness of a Verbal Classification**

The example for the Position to Know scheme is when someone in a knowledgeable position makes a claim, and that claim is accepted as true because of their position. The example given is Daniel the meteorologist asserting something about weather, and then the conclusion is that his assertion is correct.

Looking at Emily's case: She asserts that all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria. The implicit premise here is that Emily is in a position to know this (like a biologist or someone with expertise in cell biology). So the argument structure would be that because Emily is in a position to know about cell biology (position_to_know), she asserts something, and the subject (biology) contains that assertion, therefore the assertion is true.

In the Position to Know scheme, the structure is:
[position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], Ar.

So breaking down Emily's case:
- A (Agent) is emily.
- S (Subject) would be biology or cell biology, since she's talking about eukaryotic cells.
- Ar (Argument) is "all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria" which can be formalized as has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria).

Wait, but in the example, the conclusion is the assertion itself. The example's conclusion was "brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)", which was the Ar. Similarly here, the conclusion would be the Ar: that all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria.

So the premises would be:
1. position_to_know(emily, biology) – assuming her position is in biology.
2. asserts(emily, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))
3. contain(biology, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))

Therefore, the conclusion is has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria).

But let me check the example again. In the example, the predicates are:

[position_to_know(daniel,meteorology), asserts(daniel,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)), contain(meteorology,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather))], brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)

So the 'contain' predicate is that the subject (meteorology) contains the argument (the assertion). So in Emily's case, the subject (biology) must contain the assertion that eukaryotic cells have mitochondria. So the structure would be:

position_to_know(emily, S), asserts(emily, Ar), contain(S, Ar)], Ar

So substituting:

position_to_know(emily, biology), asserts(emily, all_eukaryotic_cells_have_mitochondria), contain(biology, all_eukaryotic_cells_have_mitochondria)], all_eukaryotic_cells_have_mitochondria

But how to formalize "all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria"? The example uses a predicate like brings(low_pressure_systems, stormy_weather). So maybe we can represent this as has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria) or for_all(X, eukaryotic_cell(X)  has(X, mitochondria)). But since the computational form uses predicates, perhaps the assertion is a single predicate. Let's say the assertion is has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria). So:

position_to_know(emily, biology), asserts(emily, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)), contain(biology, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))], has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)

But the original text is "Emily asserts that all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria." So in the enthymeme, the missing parts are the premises that Emily is in a position to know (like a biologist) and that the subject (biology) contains this fact. The conclusion is the assertion itself.

Therefore, the computational form should be:

[position_to_know(emily, biology), asserts(emily, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)), contain(biology, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))], has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)

But wait, in the example, the contain predicate is contain(meteorology, brings(...)). So the subject is the field (meteorology), and the argument is the specific claim. So in this case, the subject would be cell_biology or biology, and the claim is that all eukaryotic cells have mitochondria.

So perhaps more accurately:

position_to_know(emily, cell_biology), asserts(emily, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)), contain(cell_biology, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))], has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)

But the original text doesn't mention cell biology explicitly. But since Emily is making a claim about eukaryotic cells, the subject would logically be cell biology. However, the user's example uses "meteorology" as the subject. So we can model it similarly.

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(emily, cell_biology), asserts(emily, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)), contain(cell_biology, has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria))], has_all(eukaryotic_cells, mitochondria)

But I need to make sure the predicates are correctly named. The example uses "position_to_know(A,S)", "asserts(A,Ar)", "contain(S,Ar)", and the conclusion is Ar.

So the argumentation scheme is Position to Know, which requires these three premises.

In the given text, only the assertion is explicitly stated: Emily asserts the claim. The implicit premises are that Emily is in a position to know (she's an expert in the field) and that the field (cell biology) contains that claim. Therefore, the enthymeme is missing those two premises but they can be inferred.

Thus, the computational representation should include all three premises and the conclusion as per the scheme.


Okay, let's see. The user provided a context with various argumentation schemes and examples. The task is to analyze the given text "David is a geologist." and determine which argumentation scheme it fits into, then instantiate all the variables and predicates accordingly.

First, I need to look at the different schemes provided. Let me go through each one to see which fits the given text.

The text is very short: "David is a geologist." That's a single premise. But enthymemes often have missing parts, so maybe the conclusion is missing. Let's consider the possible schemes.

Looking at the Position to Know scheme: [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], Ar. The example involves someone in a position to know (like a meteorologist) making an assertion related to their field. The conclusion is that the assertion is true.

In the given text, David is a geologist. If the argument is that because David is a geologist, his assertions about geology are trustworthy, then maybe the conclusion is missing. For example, if David says something about rocks, then we can conclude that's true because of his position. But the text provided is just "David is a geologist." So maybe the user expects the rest of the argument to be inferred. However, with just this premise, it's incomplete. But perhaps the intended scheme is Position to Know, and the missing parts are the assertion and the subject matter.

Alternatively, the Classification scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). Like eagles being birds. But the text here is just stating David is a geologist. Unless there's a classification premise like "All geologists are scientists," then the conclusion would be David is a scientist. But the original text doesn't mention that. So maybe not.

The Position to Know scheme requires three premises: position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar). The conclusion is Ar. In the example, Daniel is a meteorologist (position), asserts something about low pressure, and that's contained in meteorology, so the conclusion is his assertion is true.

In the given text, the premise is David is a geologist. If the argument is that David asserts something related to geology, then we can conclude that assertion. But the text only has "David is a geologist." So maybe the user expects that the argument is missing the assertion part. For example, maybe the full argument is "David is a geologist. David says that the rock formation is ancient. Therefore, the rock formation is ancient." But in the given text, only the first premise is present. However, since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the user wants us to infer the missing parts based on the scheme.

But according to the instructions, we need to identify which scheme the presented argument belongs to, given that the text is an enthymeme (missing conclusion or premises). The text here is "David is a geologist." So maybe the intended conclusion is something David asserts, which is contained in geology, and the argument is using Position to Know. Since the example's first premise is position_to_know(daniel, meteorology), but in the given text, the premise is "David is a geologist," which would translate to position_to_know(david, geology). The other premises (asserts and contain) are missing, but since it's an enthymeme, maybe those are implied. But the problem states that the text belongs to only one of the schemes, and we need to instantiate all variables and predicates. However, with only "David is a geologist," how can we fill in all parts?

Wait, maybe the text is the first premise of the Position to Know scheme. The conclusion would be some assertion that David makes, but since the text is just the first part, perhaps the user expects us to recognize that the argument is missing the other parts, but still fit it into the Position to Know scheme by leaving variables? But the instruction says to "FULLY instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So we need to infer the missing parts based on the given text.

Alternatively, maybe the text is part of a larger argument, but the user only provided part. However, the example in the context shows that even the example enthymeme has the conclusion. For instance, in the Position to Know example, the natural language example includes the conclusion. But the given text here is just "David is a geologist." Maybe the conclusion is missing, but the user wants us to map this to the Position to Know scheme, even if some parts are missing. Wait, but in the computational form, the scheme's premises must be present. So in the example, all three premises are there: position_to_know, asserts, contain. But here, we only have one premise. So unless the other premises are implied, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of the Classification scheme. The Classification scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. But the given text here is "David is a geologist." If there's a classification premise like "All geologists are scientists," then the conclusion would be "David is a scientist." But the text doesn't provide that premise, so maybe it's not.

Alternatively, the Necessary Condition scheme. But that requires a goal and a necessary condition. Doesn't seem to fit.

The Moral Justification Ad Populum: needs everybody who is Y accepts P, and a goal. Not matching.

Effect to Cause: occurred(A), followed by occurs(B). The given text doesn't mention events.

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: requires properties related to vagueness. Not applicable here.

Double Standard: involves adopting different opinions. No.

Argument from Opposites: has_property and opposite. Not relevant.

Need for Help: would_help, can_carry_out, etc. No.

So the most plausible is Position to Know. But how to map "David is a geologist" into that scheme. Let's think.

The Position to Know scheme requires:

1. position_to_know(A, S): A is in a position to know about subject S.

2. asserts(A, Ar): A makes an assertion Ar.

3. contain(S, Ar): The subject S contains the assertion Ar.

Conclusion: Ar is true.

But the given text is only "David is a geologist." So A is David, S is geology. But the other premises (asserts and contain) are missing. Since it's an enthymeme, perhaps the conclusion is that some assertion Ar made by David is true, but those parts are missing. However, the user might expect us to infer that the missing parts are present. But how? Since the text is just stating David's position, maybe the rest is assumed. For example, if the full argument is "David is a geologist. David says that the earthquake risk is high. Therefore, the earthquake risk is high." Then the computational form would be [position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, high_earthquake_risk), contain(geology, high_earthquake_risk)], high_earthquake_risk. But the given text only has the first part. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme, so we need to infer the missing parts. But the instructions say to instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the enthymeme. So maybe the enthymeme is only providing the first premise (position_to_know), and the rest are missing. But in that case, can we fully instantiate all variables? Without knowing what David asserted, it's impossible. Unless the example is expecting to use variables for the missing parts. Wait, but in the example provided in the context for Position to Know, all three premises are present. So perhaps the given text is incomplete, but we need to map it as best as possible. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the text is supposed to be a complete enthymeme, but maybe there's a conclusion missing. For instance, the text could be "David is a geologist. Therefore, his assertions about rocks are correct." But the given text is only "David is a geologist." So maybe the example is expecting that the conclusion is missing, but the scheme requires three premises. This is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the user's instruction: "the text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples." So among the given schemes, which one does "David is a geologist" fit into? The Position to Know scheme's first premise is "position_to_know(A,S)". In the example, the first premise is "Daniel is a meteorologist and claims that...", which translates to position_to_know(daniel, meteorology). So the natural language statement "David is a geologist" would correspond to position_to_know(david, geology). But the other premises (asserts and contain) are missing. However, since the text is an enthymeme, maybe the conclusion is missing. But the computational form requires all premises to be present. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that this is part of the Position to Know scheme, but the other premises are missing, and thus the user expects us to infer them. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user provided an incomplete example, and we should proceed with the information given, even if the premises are missing. But according to the problem statement, the answer must fully instantiate all variables and predicates from the scheme. So perhaps the text is missing the other parts, but we can assume variables. However, the example in the context shows that even the premises must be fully instantiated. For example, in the Position to Know example, all three premises are present in the computational form. So unless the given text is part of a larger argument where the other premises are implied, but the user didn't provide them, making it impossible to fully instantiate.

This is a bit confusing. But considering that the user provided only "David is a geologist" as the text, and the Position to Know scheme requires three premises, I think the correct approach is to map the given statement to the first premise of the Position to Know scheme. However, the problem states that the answer must fully instantiate all variables and predicates. Therefore, unless the enthymeme is supposed to have the other premises inferred, which isn't possible without more information, this seems challenging.

Wait, maybe the intended answer is that the given text is the first premise of the Position to Know scheme, and the other premises and conclusion are missing. But the user might expect us to recognize that the argument belongs to the Position to Know scheme and instantiate as much as possible. For example:

The natural language text is "David is a geologist." Translating this to the Position to Know scheme, we have position_to_know(david, geology). But the other premises (asserts and contain) are missing. However, the problem says that the enthymeme might have missing premises or conclusion. So perhaps the argument is: David is a geologist (position_to_know). David asserts something (asserts). The subject contains the assertion (contain). Therefore, the assertion is true. But since the text only provides the first premise, the other parts are missing. However, the user wants us to map it to the Position to Know scheme, but how to instantiate the missing variables.

Alternatively, maybe the example is expecting that "David is a geologist" is part of the Position to Know scheme, and the conclusion is an assertion that David makes, which is part of geology. But without knowing what the assertion is, we can't instantiate the variables. This seems like a problem. Unless the user expects us to leave variables uninstantiated, but the examples in the context have all variables filled.

Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of the Classification scheme. The Classification scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). The example is "All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds." So the premises are classification(eagle, bird), be(white_eagle, eagle). The conclusion is be(white_eagle, bird). The given text "David is a geologist" could be the premise be(david, geologist). But then the other premise classification(geologist, X) is missing. For example, if the full argument is "All geologists are scientists. David is a geologist. Therefore, David is a scientist." But the text provided is only "David is a geologist." So the premises would be classification(geologist, scientist), be(david, geologist). But since the text is only "David is a geologist," it's missing the classification premise. Thus, the enthymeme is missing the first premise and the conclusion. Therefore, the scheme would be Classification, but the user only provides the second premise.

But the problem says the text belongs to one of the schemes. Which one is more likely? Position to Know or Classification.

Given that the example for Position to Know has a similar structure where the first premise is about someone's position (Daniel is a meteorologist), which maps to position_to_know, the given text "David is a geologist" fits the first premise of the Position to Know scheme. However, without the other premises and conclusion, it's incomplete. But the problem says to infer the missing components. So perhaps the user expects us to assume that David made an assertion related to geology, and the subject contains that assertion, leading to the conclusion that the assertion is true. But how can we infer what the assertion is?

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the argument is using the Position to Know scheme, with the given premise as position_to_know(david, geology), and the missing parts are the other premises and conclusion, which we can't fill in. But the problem requires us to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So we must infer the missing premises and conclusion based on the given text.

But how? Unless there's an implied assertion. For example, if the text continued, "David says the region is rich in minerals. Therefore, the region is rich in minerals." But since we don't have that, perhaps we need to use placeholders. However, the example in the context uses specific terms. Maybe the answer should be:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, Ar), contain(geology, Ar)], Ar.

But variables like Ar need to be instantiated. But without knowing the specific assertion, it's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that the argument belongs to the Position to Know scheme, and the given premise is position_to_know(david, geology), and the other premises and conclusion are missing but inferred as variables. However, the examples in the context don't use variables; they use specific terms.

This is a bit of a dilemma. But given the problem statement's instruction to infer the missing components, perhaps the intended answer is that the argument is using the Position to Know scheme, and the given premise is position_to_know(david, geology), with the other premises and conclusion left as variables. But the example in the context has all premises filled. So this might not be acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the text is part of the Classification scheme. For example, "David is a geologist. All geologists are scientists. Therefore, David is a scientist." But the text provided is only the second premise. So the computational form would be [classification(geologist, scientist), be(david, geologist)], be(david, scientist). But the enthymeme is missing the first premise (classification) and the conclusion. However, the user only provided the second premise. So the answer would be [classification(F,G), be(david, geologist)], be(david, G). But again, variables are not instantiated.

This is quite challenging. Given that the example for Position to Know includes three premises, and the given text only provides one, but the instructions say to infer missing parts, perhaps the answer is:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, Ar), contain(geology, Ar)], Ar.

But variables like Ar are not instantiated. However, the example in the context has specific terms. Therefore, this might not be acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the text is supposed to be part of the Classification scheme, but without the classification premise. But how?

Another angle: The user might have intended the text to be part of the Position to Know scheme, and the other premises are missing. But since the problem says to infer the missing parts, perhaps we can assume that David made an assertion related to geology, and geology contains that assertion, leading to the conclusion that the assertion is true. For example, if David asserts that a certain rock is igneous, then the conclusion is that it is igneous. But since the text doesn't specify, perhaps we have to use a generic assertion. However, the example in the context uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the answer is:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, assertion), contain(geology, assertion)], assertion.

But the example in the context uses specific predicates like brings(low_pressure_systems, stormy_weather). So using 'assertion' as a variable might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer should have placeholders, but the user expects specific terms. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, and the enthymeme is missing the other premises and conclusion. The user expects us to recognize the scheme and provide the computational form with the given premise and variables for the missing parts. But the example in the context doesn't use variables. Therefore, maybe this is a trick question, and the answer is that the argument belongs to the Classification scheme. For example, if the full argument is "Geologists are scientists. David is a geologist. Therefore, David is a scientist." But the text only provides "David is a geologist." The premises would be classification(geologist, scientist) and be(david, geologist). But since the text only provides the second premise, the computational form would have be(david, geologist) as the given premise, and the others missing. However, the problem says to infer the missing components. But without knowing the classification premise, it's impossible.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is the Position to Know scheme. The text "David is a geologist" translates to position_to_know(david, geology). The missing parts are the assertion and the contain premise, but since it's an enthymeme, the user expects us to infer them. However, without specific information, we can't. Therefore, maybe the answer is incomplete, but according to the user's instructions, we must provide the computational form with all variables instantiated. This suggests that perhaps the text is not sufficient, but given the options, the most plausible scheme is Position to Know. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, [assertion]), contain(geology, [assertion])], [assertion]

But the example uses specific terms, not variables. Therefore, maybe the answer is that the text is not a complete argument and doesn't fit any scheme. But the problem states it belongs to one of the schemes. Hence, the most logical choice is Position to Know, with the given premise and missing parts inferred. However, since the problem requires all variables and predicates to be instantiated, and the example in the context has specific terms, perhaps the intended answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Classification scheme, with be(david, geologist) as a premise, but the classification premise is missing. For example, classification(geologist, scientist), but the text doesn't provide that. Therefore, the computational form would have be(david, geologist) and the missing classification premise. But again, without that, it's incomplete.

Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is Position to Know. The premise is position_to_know(david, geology). The missing assertion and contain parts are inferred, but since we can't specify them, perhaps the answer is:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, [assertion]), contain(geology, [assertion])], [assertion]

But the example uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, with the given premise and the other premises as variables. But the problem says to instantiate all variables. This is conflicting. Given the example, where all variables are instantiated, perhaps the answer is that the text doesn't fit any scheme. But the user says it belongs to one. Therefore, I must conclude that the correct scheme is Position to Know, and the answer is:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, Ar), contain(geology, Ar)], Ar.

But variables are not allowed. The example uses specific terms. Hence, this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the answer is:

[position_to_know(david, geology)], [assertion]

But this doesn't fit the scheme.

I think I'm stuck. But given the options, the Position to Know is the closest fit, and the answer should be:

Final answer: [position_to_know(david,geology),asserts(david,Ar),contain(geology,Ar)],Ar

But the problem states that the computational form must not have variables. The example uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the answer is incorrect, but the user expects this. Alternatively, maybe the text is part of the Classification scheme, but I can't see how. Given the example for Position to Know, where the first premise is the position, the answer must be:

[position_to_know(david,geology), asserts(david,Ar), contain(geology,Ar)],Ar

But with variables, which may not be acceptable. However, the instruction says to instantiate all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. The enthymeme only provides "David is a geologist", which corresponds to position_to_know(david, geology). The other parts (asserts and contain) are missing, so we can't instantiate them. Therefore, the problem might be that the text is insufficient, but the user expects us to choose Position to Know and fill in the rest with placeholders. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text belongs to the Classification scheme with be(david, geologist), but then the other premise and conclusion are missing. 

Wait, the Classification scheme's example is:

Example 1: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. [classification(eagle,bird),be(white_eagle,eagle)],be(white_eagle,bird)

The scheme is [classification(F,G),be(A,F)],be(A,G). So the two premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F), conclusion be(A,G). The given text "David is a geologist" is be(david, geologist). If the enthymeme is missing the classification premise (like "All geologists are scientists"), then the argument would be:

Premise 1: classification(geologist, scientist)

Premise 2: be(david, geologist)

Conclusion: be(david, scientist)

But the text only provides premise 2. Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(geologist, scientist), be(david, geologist)], be(david, scientist). But the text doesn't provide the classification premise, so we can't include it. Hence, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible scheme is Position to Know. But since the other premises are missing, perhaps the answer is incomplete. However, the user's instruction says to infer the missing components. So maybe the argument is:

David is a geologist. Therefore, what he says about geology is true.

Which translates to:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, Ar), contain(geology, Ar)], Ar

But since the text only provides the first premise, the other premises and conclusion are missing. But the user wants us to infer them. Therefore, the answer must be:

[position_to_know(david, geology), asserts(david, Ar), contain(geology, Ar)], Ar

But variables are not instantiated. However, the example in the context uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, but the variables are left as placeholders. Even though the example doesn't use variables, maybe it's acceptable in this case.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is:

Final answer: [position_to_know(david,geology),asserts(david,Ar),contain(geology,Ar)],Ar


Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an argument in natural language: "James says that bacterias are unicellular microorganisms." They want me to translate this into a computational form using one of the given argumentation schemes.

First, I need to figure out which argumentation scheme this fits. Let's look at the options. The Position to Know scheme involves someone in a position to know making a claim, and the claim being part of the subject they know. The structure is [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], leading to Ar being true.

In the example, Daniel, a meteorologist, claims something about weather, which is part of meteorology. Similarly, here, James is making a statement about bacteria. If James is in a position to know (like a biologist or expert), and the statement is within his field, then the conclusion would be that the statement is true.

Looking at the text: "James says that bacterias are unicellular microorganisms." The premises needed are that James is in a position to know about microbiology (S), he asserts that bacteria are unicellular (Ar), and that this assertion is contained within his field of expertise (S contains Ar). So the scheme would fit Position to Know.

Now, instantiate the variables. A is James, S is the subject (maybe microbiology), Ar is the assertion that bacteria are unicellular. So:

position_to_know(james, microbiology), asserts(james, bacteria_are_unicellular), contain(microbiology, bacteria_are_unicellular)], then the conclusion is bacteria_are_unicellular.

Check if all parts are there. The user might not mention James's position explicitly, but since he's making a factual claim, it's inferred he has the expertise. The assertion is clear, and the subject (microbiology) contains the assertion about bacteria. So the computational form would be the Position to Know scheme with those variables filled in.


Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user provided an enthymeme, which is an argument where some parts might be missing. The task is to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. The text given is "George is a computer scientist." That's the only premise provided. 

First, I need to look at the different argumentation schemes in the context to see which one this fits. Let's go through them one by one.

Analogy based on Classification: This requires two items with similar features and a classification. The example talks about two smartphones. The text here only mentions George, so maybe not.

Effect to Cause: This involves events causing other events. The example uses customer service leading to satisfaction. Doesn't seem to fit here.

Need for Help: This involves someone being able to help and it not being costly. The example is about teachers giving books. Not relevant here.

Argument from Opposites: This deals with opposites having opposite properties. The text doesn't mention opposites, so probably not.

Moral Justification Ad Populum: Relates to what everyone does and goals. The example is about compassionate people accepting forgiveness. Doesn't fit.

Classification Argumentation scheme: The example here is "All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds." The structure here is classification(F, G), be(A, F), so be(A, G). The given text "George is a computer scientist." Could this be part of a classification argument where there's a missing premise? Maybe the conclusion is missing. Like, if all computer scientists are experts in algorithms, then George is an expert. But the user only provided "George is a computer scientist." Maybe the full argument is missing the conclusion. Wait, the enthymeme might have a missing conclusion or premise. 

Looking at the Classification scheme: The scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], so conclusion is be(A,G). The example has three parts: classification(eagle, bird), be(white_eagle, eagle), then conclusion be(white_eagle, bird). 

In the given text, "George is a computer scientist." If this is the premise be(A,F), then the missing parts would be the classification premise (classification(computer_scientist, G)) and the conclusion be(George, G). For example, if the argument is "All computer scientists are tech experts. George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a tech expert." But the user only provided "George is a computer scientist." So maybe the conclusion is missing. However, the user might be expecting to infer that the given premise is part of this scheme. But how?

Wait, the problem says the text is an enthymeme where a premise or conclusion might be missing. So maybe the given sentence is the premise be(A,F), and we need to find the classification and conclusion. But how? Unless there's an implicit classification. For example, if the argument is "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a programmer." Then the missing premise is the classification that computer scientists are programmers. But the user only provided "George is a computer scientist." So perhaps the example here is incomplete, but in the context, the classification scheme requires two premises: classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to be(A,G). The given text is one premise, so maybe the other premise and conclusion are missing. But how can we determine them?

Alternatively, maybe the argument is presented as "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, he works with computers." But the user didn't provide the conclusion. However, since the task is to translate the given argument into computational form by inferring the missing components, I need to see which argumentation scheme fits. The example given for Classification requires two premises and a conclusion. The user's text only has one premise. So, perhaps the enthymeme here is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. But how do we infer them?

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "You must correctly identify to which argumentation scheme the presented argument belongs." The text belongs to only one of the schemes provided. The given text is "George is a computer scientist." If this is part of the Classification scheme, then the other premise would be something like classification(computer_scientist, G), and the conclusion would be be(george, G). For example, if the argument is "All computer scientists are logical. George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is logical." Then the given premise is "George is a computer scientist" (be(george, computer_scientist)), the missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, logical), and the conclusion is be(george, logical). But the user only provided "George is a computer scientist." So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the other premise and the conclusion. But how can we instantiate the variables?

Wait, but in the example provided in the context for the Classification scheme, the premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). So the structure is: classification(F, G), be(A, F), so be(A, G). The given text here is "George is a computer scientist," which corresponds to be(A, F) where A is George and F is computer_scientist. To form a complete argument, we need the classification premise classification(computer_scientist, G) and the conclusion be(george, G). But since the user hasn't provided the conclusion or the other premise, we have to infer them. However, the problem states that we need to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

Therefore, the given enthymeme is part of the Classification argumentation scheme. The missing components would be the classification premise and the conclusion. But how do we infer what G is? Since the example uses "eagle" classified as "bird," maybe in this case, the classification is from computer scientist to some broader category. However, the user hasn't provided any information about that. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the conclusion. For example, if the full argument is "All computer scientists are tech experts. George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a tech expert." Then the given premise is the second one. But the user only provided "George is a computer scientist." So in this case, the missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion. However, without more context, how can we infer G?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the enthymeme here is presented as a single premise, but the conclusion is missing. For example, the argument is "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a tech expert." But the user only provided the first premise. However, the task is to instantiate the variables and predicates based on the given text, which is only "George is a computer scientist." So perhaps the intended answer is that the given sentence is the second premise (be(A,F)), and the missing parts are the classification premise and conclusion. However, without knowing G, how can we fill in the variables?

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the given sentence is the conclusion, but that doesn't fit the scheme. The Classification scheme's conclusion is be(A, G), which would be a more general category. So if the given text is the premise be(A, F), then the conclusion would be be(A, G), which is not provided. But how can we infer G?

Alternatively, maybe the example is different. Let's look again at the Classification Argumentation scheme example. The premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). The given text here is "George is a computer scientist." So in terms of the scheme, this would be be(george, computer_scientist). But where is the classification premise? Maybe the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. For example, the user's argument is "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, he is a scientist." In that case, the missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, scientist), and the conclusion is be(george, scientist). But since the user hasn't provided that, we have to infer it. However, the problem requires instantiating all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the enthymeme. So we need to see how to map "George is a computer scientist" into the Classification scheme.

The scheme's structure is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], so conclusion is be(A,G). The given text is be(george, computer_scientist). Therefore, in the computational form, the premises would be classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The conclusion is be(A,G). But since the user only provided be(A,F), we need to infer classification(F,G) and be(A,G). However, without additional information, how can we know what G is? 

Wait, maybe the problem expects that the given enthymeme is the entire argument, which is missing parts. For example, perhaps the argument is "All computer scientists are programmers. George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a programmer." But the user only provided the second premise. However, in the context examples, the Classification scheme requires both premises. So perhaps the user's text is part of such an argument, and we need to represent the given premise and infer the missing ones. But since the task is to translate the given argument into computational form by inferring the missing components, maybe the answer should include the given premise and the missing ones as variables. But that doesn't make sense because variables need to be instantiated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the given text is part of the Classification scheme, and even though only one premise is provided, we have to represent it as such. Wait, the example in the context for Classification has three parts: two premises and a conclusion. The user's text is just one sentence, which corresponds to one premise. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the other premise and the conclusion. But how can we instantiate them without knowing G?

This is confusing. Let me check the other schemes again to make sure I'm not missing something. The Position to Know scheme has [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], leading to Ar. The example is about a meteorologist asserting something. The given text is "George is a computer scientist." Maybe George has a position to know something. For instance, if George is a computer scientist, and he asserts something related to computer science, then that assertion is true. But the given text only states his position, not any assertion. So maybe not.

Another possibility is the Necessary Condition scheme. The example talks about goals and necessary conditions. The given text doesn't mention goals, so probably not.

The Vagueness of a Verbal Classification scheme involves vague properties and contexts requiring precision. The given text doesn't mention vagueness, so no.

The Double Standard scheme involves adopting different opinions. Not applicable here.

The Moral Justification Ad Populum involves goals and what others accept. Doesn't fit.

The Argument from Opposites: No opposites mentioned.

Need for Help: Not relevant.

Effect to Cause: No events.

Analogy based on Classification: No analogy.

So the only possible scheme left is the Classification Argumentation scheme. The problem is that the given text only provides one premise (be(A,F)), and we need to infer the classification premise (classification(F,G)) and the conclusion (be(A,G)). But without knowing G, how can we do that? 

Wait, perhaps in the given text, the conclusion is missing. For example, the full argument would be "All computer scientists are tech experts. George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a tech expert." But the user only provided the second premise. However, the task is to translate the given argument into computational form by inferring the missing components. Since the example in the context for the Classification scheme has two premises and a conclusion, the given enthymeme must be part of that structure. Therefore, the user's text is one premise (be(george, computer_scientist)), and we need to infer the other premise (classification(computer_scientist, G)) and the conclusion (be(george, G)). 

But how do we determine G? Since the user hasn't provided it, maybe G is a general category that computer scientists belong to, like "scientist" or "tech_professional". However, the problem requires instantiating all variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme. Since the enthymeme only states "George is a computer scientist," we have to assume that the missing parts are variables that need to be filled. But in the example, the classification is between specific categories (eagle to bird). 

Alternatively, maybe the given text is the conclusion of the argument, but that doesn't fit. Because the scheme requires the conclusion to be a broader category. For example, if the premises were classification(computer_scientist, scientist) and be(george, computer_scientist), then the conclusion would be be(george, scientist). But the given text is "George is a computer scientist," which would be the be(A,F) premise, not the conclusion. 

So, the answer must be part of the Classification scheme. The given premise is be(george, computer_scientist). The missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, G) and the conclusion is be(george, G). However, since G is unknown, how can we instantiate it? Unless the enthymeme is presented as only the conclusion, but that doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the user's text is the entire argument, but it's missing premises. For example, if the argument is "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a scientist." Then the missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, scientist). In this case, the computational form would be [classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist). But the user's text only provides the second premise. However, the problem states that the text is an enthymeme where a premise or conclusion might be missing. So perhaps the text provided is the conclusion, but that doesn't make sense because the conclusion would be the broader category. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the correct scheme is Position to Know. For example, if George is a computer scientist (position_to_know(george, computer_science)), and he asserts something, then we can conclude that assertion. But the text only states his position, not any assertion. So that doesn't fit.

Given all this, I think the correct scheme is Classification. The given text is one premise (be(george, computer_scientist)), and we need to infer the missing classification premise and conclusion. But since the user hasn't provided the other parts, perhaps we need to use variables, but the problem states to instantiate all variables. 

Wait, looking at the example in the context for Classification: the premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). The user's text is "George is a computer scientist," which is be(george, computer_scientist). So if we assume that the missing classification premise is classification(computer_scientist, scientist), then the conclusion would be be(george, scientist). Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist). But how do we know that? The user hasn't provided that classification premise. 

Alternatively, maybe the enthymeme is presented as a conclusion without premises. For example, if the argument is "George is a computer scientist. Therefore, George is a scientist." Then the missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, scientist). However, the user only provided the conclusion, which doesn't fit the scheme's structure. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The problem says the text is an enthymeme where conclusion or premises might be missing. We have to infer the missing components based on the argumentation scheme. So the text "George is a computer scientist." is part of the Classification scheme. Therefore, we need to structure it as:

[classification(F, G), be(A, F)], be(A, G)

The given text is be(A, F), where A=george and F=computer_scientist. The missing components are classification(F, G) and the conclusion be(A, G). But since the problem requires instantiating all variables, we need to define G. But without additional information, how? 

Wait, maybe the example in the context can guide us. In the example, the classification is from a specific to a general category (eagle to bird). So perhaps G is a more general category, like "scientist" or "professional". If we assume that, then:

classification(computer_scientist, scientist)

be(george, computer_scientist)

Therefore, be(george, scientist)

But the user didn't provide that. However, since the task is to infer the missing components based on the argumentation scheme, perhaps we can assume that the missing premise is classification(computer_scientist, G), and the conclusion is be(george, G). But we need to instantiate G. Since the example uses a natural category (eagle to bird), perhaps here G is "scientist". 

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist)

But the user's text only provides "George is a computer scientist," which is be(george, computer_scientist). The other premise and conclusion are missing, so we have to infer them. The problem states that the text belongs to one of the schemes, and we need to instantiate all variables and predicates. 

Therefore, the answer should be:

[classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist)

But wait, how do we know that the classification is to scientist? Maybe the user intended that. Alternatively, maybe the classification is to something else. But without more context, this is an assumption. However, given the example where eagle is classified as a bird, which is a more general category, the same logic applies here. Computer scientist is a type of scientist. 

Therefore, the computational form would be:

[classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist)

But the user's text only provides the second premise. However, the problem says to infer the missing components. So the answer should include all premises and the conclusion. 

But the user's instruction says: "You must translate the given argument to a computational form, represented in the context below, by reasoning through the present argumentative sentences and then inferring the context of the rest of the argumentation scheme."

So the given enthymeme is part of the Classification scheme. The user's text provides one premise (be(george, computer_scientist)), and the other premise (classification(computer_scientist, G)) and the conclusion (be(george, G)) are missing. Therefore, the answer is the computational form with all three parts, even though the user's text only provides one. 

But how to instantiate G? Since in the example, G is a broader category (bird), then here G should be a broader category like scientist. Therefore, the final answer would be:

[classification(computer_scientist, scientist), be(george, computer_scientist)], be(george, scientist)

But the user's text only mentions "George is a computer scientist." So where does the classification premise come from? The problem requires inferring the missing components. So even though the user didn't state it, we have to assume that the classification exists. 

Thus, the answer must be:

Final answer: [classification(computer_scientist,scientist),be(george,computer_scientist)],be(george,scientist)


Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an argument in natural language: "Peter says that smoking causes cancer." We need to translate this into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context.

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme fits this statement. Let me go through the examples provided in the context.

Looking at the Position to Know scheme example: Daniel, a meteorologist, claims something about weather, and because of his position, the conclusion is accepted. The structure here is that someone in a position to know about a subject makes an assertion related to that subject, and the argument concludes that the assertion is true.

In the given text, Peter is making a statement about smoking causing cancer. If Peter is in a position to know about this topic (like a medical expert or researcher), then this fits the Position to Know scheme. The scheme requires three premises: position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar), leading to the conclusion Ar.

Now, breaking down the sentence: "Peter says that smoking causes cancer." The assertion here is "smoking causes cancer." We need to determine Peter's position. Since the text doesn't specify, we might infer that Peter is an authority in a relevant field (like oncology or public health). The subject (S) would be that field, say, oncology. The assertion (Ar) is "smoking causes cancer," which is contained within the subject of oncology.

So, the premises would be:
1. position_to_know(peter, oncology)
2. asserts(peter, causes(smoking, cancer))
3. contain(oncology, causes(smoking, cancer))

The conclusion is the assertion itself: causes(smoking, cancer).

Checking the Position to Know example, the structure matches. Variables are A = peter, S = oncology, Ar = causes(smoking, cancer). So the computational form should be:

[position_to_know(peter, oncology), asserts(peter, causes(smoking, cancer)), contain(oncology, causes(smoking, cancer))], causes(smoking, cancer)

I need to ensure all variables and predicates are correctly instantiated. The text doesn't explicitly state Peter's position, but the argument relies on his authority, so we infer his position. The subject (oncology) is a reasonable domain where smoking causing cancer is discussed. The assertion is clearly stated. This fits the scheme.


Okay, let's see. The user provided an enthymeme and wants me to translate it into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. The text given is "Lisa is an economist." That's all. Hmm, so I need to figure out which argumentation scheme this fits into.

Looking at the context examples, there are several schemes like Analogy, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, etc. The Position to Know scheme seems relevant here. The Position to Know scheme has premises about someone being in a position to know something, asserting a claim, and the subject containing that claim. The example given was Daniel the meteorologist asserting something about weather, leading to the conclusion that his assertion is correct.

In the provided text, the statement is "Lisa is an economist." This seems like establishing Lisa's position. If this is part of an argument, maybe the conclusion is something she would assert because of her position. But the user only provided that one sentence. Since it's an enthymeme, either the premises or conclusion is missing. 

The Position to Know scheme requires three premises: position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar). The conclusion is Ar. But in the given text, we only have "Lisa is an economist." So perhaps the missing parts are her asserting something and the subject containing that assertion. However, the text doesn't mention her making any claim. Wait, maybe the enthymeme is missing the conclusion that she should be trusted on economic matters? But how does that fit the scheme?

Wait, the Position to Know example had Daniel being a meteorologist (position_to_know), asserting something about the weather, and the conclusion is his assertion. So in the example, the conclusion is the claim he made. If Lisa is an economist (position_to_know), then perhaps the missing parts are her asserting a specific economic claim, and that claim being part of economics. But since the text only states her position, maybe the enthymeme is missing the premises where she makes an assertion and that the subject (economics) contains it. But the user hasn't provided that. 

Wait, but maybe the enthymeme here is just the first premise, and the conclusion is implied. But the user expects us to instantiate all variables based on the given text. Let me check the structure again. The Position to Know scheme is [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], leading to Ar as the conclusion. But in the given text, only "Lisa is an economist" is present. So unless there's more to the argument, maybe this isn't the right scheme. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the example is incomplete. Let's look at the example for Position to Know. The premises were Daniel's position, his assertion, and that the subject (meteorology) contains the assertion. The conclusion was the assertion itself. In the given text, "Lisa is an economist" could be the first premise (position_to_know(lisa, economics)). But without her making an assertion, maybe the user expects us to infer that there's an implied assertion. But the enthymeme provided is just one premise. Wait, perhaps the intended scheme is the Classification Argumentation scheme. Wait, the Classification scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], leading to be(A,G). For example, all eagles are birds, white eagles are eagles, so they are birds. But here, the statement is "Lisa is an economist." If the conclusion is missing, perhaps it's something like "Therefore, Lisa's opinions on economics should be trusted," but that's not a classification. Alternatively, maybe the scheme is Position to Know, but the other premises are missing. But the user says to infer the missing components. Since the text is "Lisa is an economist," maybe the rest is implicit. For example, if Lisa is in a position to know economics (S), asserts some claim (Ar), and that claim is part of economics, then Ar is true. But the text only states her position. Unless the argument is that because she's an economist, her assertions in economics should be accepted. But the user's example includes all premises. Wait, maybe the user's example has the conclusion as the assertion. So if the enthymeme is "Lisa is an economist. Therefore, Ar." But without knowing Ar, we can't fill it in. But the user says to instantiate all variables and predicates by inferring missing components. Maybe the text is part of a larger argument where Lisa's position is used to support her assertion. But since the text is only "Lisa is an economist," perhaps the argument is incomplete, and we need to map it to the Position to Know scheme with the given part. For example, if the full argument is "Lisa is an economist. She asserts that the economy will grow. Economics contains the study of economic growth. Therefore, the economy will grow." But since we only have the first premise, we need to infer the rest. But how? Maybe the user wants the computational form with variables. Wait, the Position to Know scheme's structure is [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], Ar. So given only "Lisa is an economist," perhaps A is lisa, S is economics. But we need to fill in Ar and the other premises. But since the user says to infer missing components, maybe assume that there's an implicit assertion and that the subject contains it. However, without more information, this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of another scheme. Let me check other schemes. 

Looking at the Classification Argumentation scheme: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). The example was all eagles are birds, white eagles are eagles, so white eagles are birds. But in the given text, "Lisa is an economist" is just a classification. If the conclusion is missing, maybe the argument is that economists are classified as experts, so Lisa is an expert. But the given text doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use the Classification scheme where F is economist and G is some class. But with the given info, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the Moral Justification Ad Populum: [everybody_who_is(Y,accept(P)), goal_of(X,Y)], should(X,accept(P)). But the given text doesn't fit that. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is using the Position to Know scheme, but with placeholders. For instance, the user's text is "Lisa is an economist," so in the computational form, we have position_to_know(lisa, economics). But the other premises (asserts and contain) are missing. However, the user says to instantiate all variables and predicates by inferring the missing components. But how? Unless the enthymeme is missing the conclusion and other premises. For example, if the full argument is "Lisa is an economist. She says the recession will end next quarter. Therefore, the recession will end next quarter." Then the computational form would have position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, recession_ends_next_quarter), contain(economics, recession_ends_next_quarter), leading to the conclusion. But since the text provided is only the first premise, perhaps we can't complete the scheme. But the user's instruction says that the text is an enthymeme where premises or conclusion might be missing. So we have to infer the rest. 

Wait, maybe the answer is that the given text is the first premise of the Position to Know scheme, and the other premises and conclusion are missing. But according to the example, the scheme requires all three premises. However, the user might expect that the enthymeme is missing the other premises and conclusion, and we need to present the computational form with variables filled in as much as possible. But without more information, this is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the text is part of a different scheme. Let me check again. 

Wait, the example for Position to Know had three premises and a conclusion. The given text only provides one premise. So unless the enthymeme is missing the other premises and conclusion, but the user expects us to map it to the Position to Know scheme with the given premise. For example, the computational form would have position_to_know(lisa, economics), and the other premises and conclusion would be variables. But the user says to "FULLY instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So we have to infer what's missing. But how? Maybe the enthymeme is only the first premise, and the rest is implicit. However, without more context, this is impossible. Unless the user made a mistake, but assuming the text is part of a Position to Know argument. 

Alternatively, maybe the text is part of a Classification argument. For example, "Lisa is an economist. All economists are experts. Therefore, Lisa is an expert." But the given text is only the first premise. But the user's example of the Classification scheme requires two premises: classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The given text is be(A,F), so if the classification premise is missing, perhaps the enthymeme is missing that. But the user's instruction says to infer the missing components. So perhaps in this case, the argument is: All economists are classified as experts. Lisa is an economist. Therefore, Lisa is an expert. But the given text only has "Lisa is an economist." So the missing components would be the classification premise. But the user didn't provide that. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is using the Position to Know scheme, with the given premise and assuming the other premises. But since there's no assertion or containment stated, perhaps the answer is incomplete. Wait, but the user's example had the full argument. So maybe in this case, the given text is just the first part, and the rest is missing, but we can't infer it. Therefore, perhaps this isn't the right scheme. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the Position to Know example again. The first premise is position_to_know(daniel, meteorology), the second is asserts(daniel, brings(low_pressure_systems, stormy_weather)), and the third is contain(meteorology, brings(...)). The conclusion is the assertion. So in the given text, if the enthymeme is "Lisa is an economist. Therefore, [some assertion]." But since the text is just "Lisa is an economist," maybe the intended scheme is Position to Know, but with the missing parts. But the user might be expecting to map "Lisa is an economist" to the first premise of Position to Know, and the rest is missing. However, the user says to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." So we need to infer the missing premises and conclusion. But how? Unless the enthymeme is part of a larger argument where Lisa makes a claim, but it's not provided here. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text belongs to the Classification Argumentation scheme. The scheme is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). For example, if we have "All economists are experts. Lisa is an economist. Therefore, Lisa is an expert." The given text is "Lisa is an economist," which is the be(A,F) part. But the classification premise is missing. However, the user says to infer the missing parts. So maybe the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. But without any mention of classification, it's hard to infer. 

Wait, the user's example for the Classification scheme had "All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds." So the classification(F,G) is the first premise. In the given text, "Lisa is an economist" could be the second premise (be(A,F)), but we need the first premise (classification(economist, G)). But since that's not provided, perhaps this isn't applicable. 

Hmm. This is tricky. The text is very minimal. Let me check all schemes again. 

Another possibility: Necessary Condition scheme. But that requires a goal and a necessary condition. The given text doesn't mention goals. 

Effect to Cause: [occured(A), followed(A,B)], occurs(B). Not applicable here. 

Moral Justification Ad Populum: Needs a goal and acceptance. Not matching. 

Argument from Opposites: Requires opposites and properties. Not here. 

Need for Help: Involves helping actions. Not relevant. 

Vagueness of Verbal Classification: Has properties of vagueness. Not applicable. 

Double Standard: Different treatments. Not here. 

So, the only possible schemes left are Position to Know or Classification. 

Given that "Lisa is an economist" establishes her position, perhaps the Position to Know is the right scheme. But to fully instantiate the scheme, we need all three premises. Since the user's instruction says to infer missing components, maybe we need to assume that Lisa asserts something related to economics, and that economics contains that assertion. But without the specific assertion, how can we instantiate variables? 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the given text is part of the Position to Know scheme with the other premises missing, but the user expects the answer to only include the given part. Wait, but the example in the context includes all premises. For instance, the example for Position to Know has three premises and the conclusion. If the given text is only one premise, how can we map it? Unless the user made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo and the text is incomplete. But given the information, I have to work with what's provided. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the argument is part of the Classification scheme, with the first premise (classification(economist, G)) missing and the conclusion (be(lisa, G)) missing. But without knowing G, I can't fill it in. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text belongs to the Classification scheme with the given premise as be(A,F), and the other parts are missing. But according to the user's example, the Classification scheme requires two premises and a conclusion. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text is the first premise of the Position to Know scheme, and the rest is missing. But the user says to instantiate all variables. So in the computational form, we have to have all premises. But without knowing the specific assertion and the subject's containment, perhaps we can't. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the enthymeme is missing the conclusion that Lisa's assertions in economics are correct. So the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But since the text only provides the first premise, and the others are missing, but the user says to infer, maybe the answer is to use variables for the missing parts. However, the user's example uses concrete terms. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the given text is part of the Position to Know scheme, and the missing parts are variables. But the user's example uses specific terms. For example, in the example, the conclusion is the assertion. So if the text is "Lisa is an economist," and the argument is that she asserts something in economics, then the conclusion is that assertion. But without knowing what she asserts, we can't fill it in. 

This is confusing. The user's instruction says the text belongs to only one of the schemes provided. The Position to Know scheme requires three premises and a conclusion. The given text is only one premise. Unless the enthymeme is structured such that "Lisa is an economist" is the only premise, and the conclusion is an assertion she makes. But without the assertion, we can't complete it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, but the other premises are omitted, and the conclusion is her assertion. So the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But since Ar is a variable, the user might want it instantiated. But without information, we can't. 

But according to the user's example, the variables are instantiated. For example, in the example, the variables A is daniel, S is meteorology, Ar is brings(low_pressure_systems, stormy_weather). So perhaps in this case, we have to infer Ar. But how? The text is just "Lisa is an economist." Unless there's an implicit assertion. But the user hasn't provided any. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text doesn't fit any scheme, but the user says it must belong to one. Therefore, I must choose the best fit. The Position to Know seems the closest, but with missing parts. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme. For example, if the classification is that economists are professionals, and Lisa is an economist, so she's a professional. But the given text is only "Lisa is an economist," which is the second premise. The first premise (classification(economist, professional)) is missing, and the conclusion (be(lisa, professional)) is missing. 

But the user's instruction says to infer missing components. So perhaps the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. So the computational form would be:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But G is a variable. However, the user's example uses specific terms, not variables. For instance, in the example, F is eagle, G is bird. So unless there's more context, we can't fill in G. 

This is challenging. Since the text is very minimal, and the user wants the computational form, perhaps the answer is using the Position to Know scheme with placeholders. But the user's example has concrete terms. 

Wait, maybe the text is the entire argument, and we have to see which scheme it fits. But "Lisa is an economist." alone is not an argument. It's a statement. An argument requires premises leading to a conclusion. So the enthymeme must be missing parts. For example, maybe the full argument is "Lisa is an economist. Therefore, her economic predictions are accurate." But without the other premises, how to map? 

Alternatively, the text is part of a Position to Know argument where the other premises are implicit. For example, "Lisa is an economist. She says the economy is improving. Therefore, the economy is improving." The computational form would be position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, economy_improving), contain(economics, economy_improving), leading to economy_improving. But given only "Lisa is an economist," we can't fill in the rest. 

This is a dead end. Maybe the answer is that the text belongs to the Position to Know scheme, and the computational form is:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But since Ar is a variable, and the user's example uses concrete terms, perhaps this is not correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme, with:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But again, G is a variable. 

Given the user's example for the Position to Know scheme, the conclusion is the assertion made by the person in the position. If the text is "Lisa is an economist," and the conclusion is missing, perhaps the computational form requires the other premises. But without them, I can't. 

Wait, the user might have intended this to be a trick question where the answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme, but the example provided by the user for Classification uses 'be' predicates. The given text "Lisa is an economist" is a 'be' predicate. The Classification scheme's premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to be(A,G). So if the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion, but given only be(A,F), perhaps the answer is:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But since the classification premise is missing, and the user says to infer missing components, maybe the classification premise is assumed. For example, if economists are classified as experts, then the argument would be:

All economists are experts. Lisa is an economist. Therefore, Lisa is an expert. 

But the given text is only "Lisa is an economist," so the missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion. But how can we infer the classification premise? The user's instruction says to infer missing components, so perhaps we need to assume that there's a classification from economist to some category. But without information, this is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text belongs to the Classification scheme, and the computational form is:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But since G is not provided, this can't be instantiated. 

Given the ambiguity, but the user's instruction to choose the correct scheme, I think the Position to Know is the best fit because "Lisa is an economist" establishes her position. The missing parts would be her assertion and the subject containing it. But without specific information, perhaps the answer uses variables. However, the user's example uses specific terms, not variables. 

Wait, the user's example for Position to Know uses specific terms for Ar. Maybe the answer expects that the assertion is missing and thus can't be instantiated. But the user's instruction says to "FULLY instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components."

Since the enthymeme is "Lisa is an economist," and it's part of a Position to Know argument, the only premise we can instantiate is position_to_know(lisa, economics). The other premises and conclusion require information not provided. Therefore, perhaps the answer is invalid. But the user insists it belongs to one scheme. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme with the given premise and missing classification. But the user's example for Classification uses two premises. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. The user provided a context where each scheme has an example. The text is "Lisa is an economist." Looking at the Position to Know example, the first premise is "Daniel is a meteorologist," which is position_to_know(daniel, meteorology). Similarly, "Lisa is an economist" would be position_to_know(lisa, economics). So if the enthymeme is just the first premise of the Position to Know scheme, then the computational form would be position_to_know(lisa, economics), but the other premises and conclusion are missing. But the user's instruction says to instantiate all variables and predicates. 

Wait, the user's example for Position to Know includes all three premises and the conclusion. So if the text provided is just the first premise, but the scheme requires three premises, then the answer must infer the missing premises and conclusion. But how? 

Unless the enthymeme is missing the other premises and the conclusion, but we can infer them from context. For example, if Lisa is an economist (position_to_know), and she asserts some economic claim (Ar), which is part of economics, then Ar is the conclusion. But without knowing Ar, we can't fill it in. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects us to recognize that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme and represents the first premise, with the other premises and conclusion left as variables. But the user's example uses concrete terms, not variables. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text doesn't fit any scheme, but the user says it must. Therefore, the most likely scheme is Position to Know, with the given premise and the others left as variables. But the user's example doesn't use variables. 

Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the Position to Know scheme, filling in the first premise and leaving the others as variables. However, the user's examples use specific terms. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the text is part of the Classification scheme. 

Wait, in the Classification scheme example, the premises are classification(eagle, bird) and be(white_eagle, eagle), leading to be(white_eagle, bird). The given text "Lisa is an economist" is similar to be(white_eagle, eagle). So if the argument is "All economists are experts. Lisa is an economist. Therefore, Lisa is an expert." Then the computational form would be [classification(economist, expert), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, expert). But the given text is only the second premise. So the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion. But the user says to infer missing components. If the text is "Lisa is an economist," then perhaps the missing classification premise is classification(economist, expert), and the conclusion is be(lisa, expert). But without any mention of "expert," this is an inference. 

But the user's instruction says to infer missing components. So maybe the answer is:

[classification(economist, expert), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, expert).

But the problem is that "expert" is not mentioned in the text. However, the user might expect that since economists are a type of expert, this is a reasonable inference. 

But according to the user's example for Classification, the first premise is classification(eagle, bird), which is a general statement. So if the enthymeme is missing that premise, then the computational form would be:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But G is a variable. However, the user's example uses specific terms, not variables. So this might not be correct. 

Given the ambiguity, and the user's context examples, I think the Position to Know scheme is more appropriate, as "Lisa is an economist" establishes her position. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But Ar is a variable, which isn't instantiated. However, the user's example uses specific terms, so perhaps the answer is expecting a different approach. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "the text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided in the examples." Looking at the Position to Know example, the first premise is about the person's position. The given text is about Lisa's position. So it's likely the Position to Know scheme. The other premises and conclusion are missing but must be inferred. 

But how? Without more information, perhaps the answer is that the computational form is:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics)], Ar.

But this doesn't fit the scheme's structure. The scheme requires three premises. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, and the other premises are assumed to be present but not stated. But the user wants the computational form with all premises instantiated. 

Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the correct answer is the Position to Know scheme, with the premises and conclusion inferred as follows:

Lisa is an economist (position_to_know(lisa, economics)). She asserts some claim related to economics (asserts(lisa, claim)), and economics contains that claim (contain(economics, claim)). Therefore, the claim is true. 

But since the claim is not specified, we can't instantiate it. However, the user's example uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, but the computational form can't be fully instantiated. But the user insists on providing the exact format. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the text is part of the Position to Know scheme, and the computational form is:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But since Ar is a variable, and the user's example uses a specific assertion, this might not be acceptable. However, maybe the user accepts variables. 

But looking back, the user's example in the Position to Know scheme has specific terms for Ar, like brings(low_pressure_systems, stormy_weather). So variables aren't used in the examples. Therefore, perhaps the answer is incorrect. 

Wait, another angle: The user's example for the Classification scheme is [classification(eagle, bird), be(white_eagle, eagle)], be(white_eagle, bird). The given text "Lisa is an economist" is similar to be(white_eagle, eagle). If the argument is missing the classification premise, maybe the answer is:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But G is a variable. However, the user's example doesn't use variables. Therefore, this might not be correct. 

I'm really stuck here. Given the user's instruction and the examples, the Position to Know scheme seems the best fit. The text provides the first premise. The other premises and conclusion are missing but must be inferred. However, without specific information, we can't fill them in. But the user says to "FULLY Instantiate ALL the variables and predicates from the argumentation scheme given the natural language enthymeme provided below by inferring the missing components." 

This implies that even if the enthymeme is missing parts, we must infer them. For example, if the enthymeme is "Lisa is an economist. Therefore, her assertion is correct." Then the missing premises are her assertion and that economics contains it. But since the text doesn't mention her assertion, how can we infer it? 

Perhaps the user made a mistake in the example, or the text is incomplete. But I have to proceed. 

Given the Position to Know scheme's structure, and the given text, the only possible way to instantiate the scheme is to assume that the other premises are present but not stated. Therefore, the computational form would be:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But since Ar is a variable, and the user's example uses a specific term, this might not be acceptable. However, it's the only way to fit the scheme. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the text doesn't fit any scheme, but the user says it must. Therefore, I'll go with the Position to Know scheme, even if the computational form has variables. 

But the user's example doesn't use variables, so this is conflicting. 

Wait, maybe the answer is:

[position_to_know(lisa, economics)], [].

But the scheme requires three premises. 

I'm really not sure, but I'll conclude that the correct answer is the Position to Know scheme with the given premise and the others as variables. However, the user's example uses specific terms, so maybe the answer is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the text is part of the Classification scheme with the computational form:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But again, G is a variable. 

Given the time I've spent, I'll settle on the Position to Know scheme, even if incomplete. 

Final answer: [position_to_know(lisa, economics), asserts(lisa, Ar), contain(economics, Ar)], Ar.

But the user's example has specific terms, so maybe the answer should have no variables. But without additional information, this is impossible. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended the text to be part of the Classification scheme. For example, "Lisa is an economist. All economists are classified as professionals. Therefore, Lisa is a professional." The computational form would be [classification(economist, professional), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, professional). But the given text is only "Lisa is an economist," so the missing parts are the classification premise and the conclusion. The user's instruction says to infer missing components. So maybe the answer is:

[classification(economist, professional), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, professional).

But the problem is that "professional" is not mentioned in the text. However, the user might expect that economists are professionals, so this is inferred. 

If that's the case, then the correct scheme is Classification. 

But how to determine which scheme is correct? The key is to match the structure of the argument. The given text is a single premise, so the scheme must have a structure that allows for that. 

The Classification scheme requires two premises and a conclusion. If the given text is one premise, then the other premise and conclusion are missing. 

The Position to Know scheme requires three premises and a conclusion. Given one premise, the others are missing. 

But the user's instruction says to identify the correct scheme based on the text provided. Since the text is "Lisa is an economist," which is a classification statement (be(A, F)), the scheme is more likely to be Classification. 

In the example for the Classification scheme, the premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F). The given text is be(lisa, economist). So if the enthymeme is missing the classification premise and the conclusion, the answer would be:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But G is a variable. However, the user's example uses specific terms. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the text belongs to the Classification scheme with the given premise and the missing parts inferred. 

Thus, the computational form is:

[classification(economist, G), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, G).

But since the user's example uses specific terms, maybe G is inferred as a superclass of economist, like professional or expert. However, without explicit mention, this is an assumption. 

But the user's instruction says to "infer the missing components," so we have to make a logical inference. 

Therefore, the answer is:

[classification(economist, professional), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, professional).

This fits the Classification scheme. 

But how do we know the classification is to professional? Because economists are a type of professional. It's a reasonable inference. 

Therefore, the computational form is:

[classification(economist, professional), be(lisa, economist)], be(lisa, professional).

This matches the Classification scheme's structure. 

So, after considering all possibilities, I conclude that the correct scheme is Classification, and the missing premise and conclusion are inferred as classification(economist, professional) and be(lisa, professional).


Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to translate the given natural language argument into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the context provided. The text given is "Mark maintains that form follows function in architectural design." 

First, I need to identify which argumentation scheme this belongs to. Looking at the examples provided in the context:

The Position to Know scheme involves someone in a position to know making an assertion that is contained within their area of expertise. The example given is a meteorologist asserting something about weather, which is then accepted as true because of their position. 

In the text, Mark is maintaining a principle in architectural design. If Mark is an architect or someone in a relevant position, then his assertion about form following function would fall under the Position to Know scheme. The structure of that scheme is [position_to_know(A,S), asserts(A,Ar), contain(S,Ar)], leading to Ar being true.

So, let's break down the sentence. "Mark maintains that form follows function in architectural design." 

- A (the person) is Mark.
- S (the subject area) would be architectural design, since that's the field here.
- Ar (the assertion) is "form follows function."
- The argument is that because Mark is in a position to know about architectural design (position_to_know(mark, architectural_design)), and he asserts that form follows function (asserts(mark, form_follows_function)), and architectural design contains the principle that form follows function (contain(architectural_design, form_follows_function)), then the conclusion is that form_follows_function is true.

Wait, but does the original text explicitly state that Mark is in a position to know? The example had Daniel as a meteorologist, which is his position. Here, the text just says Mark maintains something. Maybe the assumption is that Mark is an architect or expert in architectural design, hence in a position to know. Since enthymemes often leave out premises, we might need to infer that Mark's position is relevant. However, the problem says to instantiate all variables and predicates given the natural language enthymeme. The text doesn't explicitly state Mark's position, but the example didn't either for Daniel's case—it just said Daniel is a meteorologist. Here, maybe the user expects that "maintains" implies that Mark has the position to know. Hmm. Wait, looking back at the Position to Know example: "Daniel is a meteorologist and claims that..." So in that case, Daniel's position is part of the premise. But in the given text, Mark's position isn't stated. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The original text says "Mark maintains that form follows function in architectural design." So the key here is that Mark is making an assertion (asserts) about architectural design. The Position to Know scheme requires that the person is in a position to know about the subject (S), which here is architectural design. So maybe the enthymeme is missing the premise that Mark is in a position to know about architectural design. But since enthymemes can have missing premises, perhaps we need to infer that. Wait, but the user instructions say to infer the missing components. So the given text is the enthymeme, and we need to fill in the missing premises. So the argument is: Mark asserts form follows function in architectural design. Therefore, form follows function. The missing premise is that Mark is in a position to know about architectural design, and that the subject (architectural design) contains the assertion. So the computational form would be [position_to_know(mark, architectural_design), asserts(mark, form_follows_function), contain(architectural_design, form_follows_function)], and the conclusion is form_follows_function. 

Checking the example again: [position_to_know(daniel,meteorology),asserts(daniel,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)),contain(meteorology,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather))],brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather). 

In the example, Daniel's position (meteorology) and the subject area (meteorology) contains the assertion. Similarly, in the given text, Mark's position would be architectural design (assuming he's an architect), and the assertion is about architectural design, so the subject (S) is architectural design, and the assertion is contained in that subject. 

Therefore, the variables would be:

A = mark

S = architectural_design

Ar = form_follows_function

Thus, the premises are position_to_know(mark, architectural_design), asserts(mark, form_follows_function), contain(architectural_design, form_follows_function). Conclusion is form_follows_function.

So the computational representation should be:

[position_to_know(mark,architectural_design),asserts(mark,form_follows_function),contain(architectural_design,form_follows_function)],form_follows_function.

I need to check if the predicates are correctly instantiated. The example used position_to_know, asserts, contain, and the conclusion is the assertion. Yes. So the answer should follow that structure.


Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an enthymeme, which is an argument where either the conclusion or some premises might be missing. The task is to translate this into a computational form using the correct argumentation scheme from the given context. 

First, let's recall the context examples and the various argumentation schemes provided. The possible schemes include Analogy based on Classification, Effect to Cause, Need for Help, Argument from Opposites, Moral Justification Ad Populum, Classification, Necessary Condition, Position to Know, Double Standard, Vagueness of a Verbal Classification.

The given text is "John is a physicist." That's a very short statement. Since it's an enthymeme, we need to figure out the missing parts of the argument. The example in the Classification Argumentation scheme is:

Example 1: All eagles are birds. White eagles are eagles. Therefore, white eagles are birds. The computational form is [classification(eagle,bird),be(white_eagle,eagle)],be(white_eagle,bird).

The scheme here is [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). So the premises are that there's a classification (F is a G), and A is an F, therefore A is a G.

Looking at the text "John is a physicist." If this is part of a Classification argument, maybe there's a missing premise. For example, if the argument is: All physicists are scientists. John is a physicist. Therefore, John is a scientist. But in the given text, only "John is a physicist" is present. Wait, but the conclusion might be missing. Wait, the enthymeme might have a missing conclusion or premise. 

Wait, the user says that the argument is an enthymeme where conclusion or premises might be missing. So the text provided is part of the argument, but parts are missing. So the text given is "John is a physicist." Maybe the full argument is something like:

All physicists are scientists. John is a physicist. Therefore, John is a scientist.

But in the text, maybe only "John is a physicist" is given, and the other premises or conclusion are missing. But how does the example in the context work? The example for Classification scheme has two premises and a conclusion. The given text here is a single statement. So perhaps the argument is missing either the classification premise or the conclusion. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is structured as: John is a physicist. All physicists are scientists. Therefore, John is a scientist. But in the text provided, only "John is a physicist" is stated, implying that the other premises and conclusion are missing. However, the task is to translate the given argument into the computational form, inferring the missing parts based on the scheme.

But let's look at the Classification Argumentation scheme structure: [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). So the two premises are classification(F,G) and be(A,F), leading to the conclusion be(A,G). 

If the given text is "John is a physicist," which would correspond to be(A,F) where A is John and F is physicist. But then we need the classification premise, which would be classification(physicist, G), where G is a superclass. For example, classification(physicist, scientist). Then the conclusion would be be(john, scientist). 

But the original text only states "John is a physicist." So perhaps the missing premise is the classification, and the conclusion is that John is a scientist (or whatever the superclass is). But since the enthymeme is only given as "John is a physicist," how can we infer the rest?

Wait, maybe the argument is presented as "John is a physicist. Therefore, he is a scientist." But the premise here would be the classification. Alternatively, if the enthymeme is presented as "John is a physicist. All physicists are scientists. Therefore, John is a scientist." But the text given is only "John is a physicist." So maybe the user expects us to infer the missing classification premise and the conclusion.

However, in the example given in the context, the premises are "All eagles are birds" (classification(eagle, bird)), and "White eagles are eagles" (be(white_eagle, eagle)), leading to the conclusion "White eagles are birds" (be(white_eagle, bird)). 

So in this case, if the given text is "John is a physicist," perhaps the missing parts are the classification premise (e.g., physicists are scientists) and the conclusion (John is a scientist). Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(physicist, scientist), be(john, physicist)], be(john, scientist). 

But the original text is just "John is a physicist." How do we know the classification premise and the conclusion? The user must infer the missing parts based on the structure of the argumentation scheme. Since the text is an enthymeme, we need to identify which scheme it fits and then fill in the missing parts.

The text "John is a physicist" is a statement that something belongs to a class. The Classification scheme requires two premises: a classification (F is a G) and that A is an F, leading to A is a G. But the given text only has "be(A, F)" (John is a physicist). So the missing premise is the classification (physicist is a G), and the conclusion is be(A, G). 

But the problem is to instantiate all variables and predicates given the natural language enthymeme. So perhaps the argument is that John is a physicist, and since physicists are scientists, John is a scientist. But the text provided only includes "John is a physicist," so we have to assume the rest. 

Alternatively, maybe the example in the context uses "be" for the second premise, which is that the subject belongs to a subclass. So if "John is a physicist" is the second premise (be(john, physicist)), then the first premise must be classification(physicist, scientist). The conclusion would be be(john, scientist). 

Thus, the computational form would be [classification(physicist, scientist), be(john, physicist)], be(john, scientist). 

But the user's text only provides "John is a physicist," which is one of the premises. So the other premise (classification) and conclusion are missing. Therefore, the task is to infer these based on the scheme. 

So the answer should be the Classification Argumentation scheme. The variables and predicates would be:

classification(F, G) where F is physicist and G is scientist (assuming), be(A, F) where A is John, and the conclusion be(A, G). 

But how to determine G? The example uses "eagle" and "bird." So in the example, F is eagle, G is bird. Similarly, here, F is physicist, G would be a more general class, like scientist. But the text doesn't mention it. However, since the enthymeme is missing parts, we have to infer the missing classification premise. 

Therefore, the computational form would be [classification(physicist, scientist), be(john, physicist)], be(john, scientist). 

But the user's text only provides "John is a physicist," which is the be(A,F) part. The other premise and conclusion are missing, but according to the scheme, we need to instantiate all variables and predicates. Therefore, the answer should include both premises and the conclusion, even if they are inferred. 

So the final answer should be in the format [classification(physicist, G), be(john, physicist)], be(john, G). But what is G? Since the example uses a general class, perhaps G is a placeholder. But in the example, it's specific. Wait, in the example, the classification is explicit: All eagles are birds. So the classification is from a specific class to a more general one. 

In the given text, "John is a physicist" would be the be(A,F) part. To complete the scheme, we need the classification premise. But since the text doesn't mention it, we have to infer it. But how? Maybe the user expects us to use variables as in the example. Wait, the example uses 'eagle' and 'bird' as F and G. In the user's case, F is 'physicist', G would be a superclass like 'scientist'. But since the text doesn't provide that, maybe we need to use variables or assume a general category. 

Alternatively, maybe the argument is simply that John is a physicist, and that's the conclusion. But that doesn't fit the scheme. The Classification scheme requires two premises and a conclusion. Since the given text is only one premise, we need to infer the other. 

Wait, maybe the argument is presented as "John is a physicist. Therefore, John is a scientist." But the premise "All physicists are scientists" is missing. So the enthymeme here is missing the classification premise. Therefore, the computational form would include that missing premise. 

Therefore, the instantiated scheme would be:

classification(physicist, scientist), be(john, physicist), and conclusion be(john, scientist). 

But the problem states that the text belongs to only one of the argumentation schemes provided. The text "John is a physicist" is a simple statement of classification. The example given for the Classification scheme uses two premises and a conclusion. So the given text is part of such an argument. 

Therefore, the answer must follow the structure [classification(F,G), be(A,F)], be(A,G). 

So the variables are:

F = physicist

G = ? (We need to infer, perhaps 'scientist' as in the example with eagle and bird)

A = john

Thus, the premises would be classification(physicist, scientist) and be(john, physicist), leading to be(john, scientist). 

But since the text only provides "John is a physicist," the other premise and conclusion are missing. Therefore, the answer should include the classification premise (even if it's inferred) and the conclusion. 

Hence, the computational form is [classification(physicist, scientist), be(john, physicist)], be(john, scientist). 

But how do we know that 'scientist' is the correct G? The text doesn't specify, but in the example, the classification is from a specific to a general category. Physicist is a type of scientist, so that's plausible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the classification is from 'physicist' to 'academic' or another category, but 'scientist' is the most logical. 

Therefore, the final computational argument should be:

[classification(physicist,scientist),be(john,physicist)],be(john,scientist)
