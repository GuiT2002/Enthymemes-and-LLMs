Argumentation scheme: [goal(Sn),necessary_condition(Sn,Si)],is_necessary(Si). Example 1: Pursuing advancements in renewable energy technology is my objective. In order to realize this, investing in solar power infrastructure is necessary. Therefore, I need to invest in solar power infrastructure. [goal(pursue(advancements,renewable_energy_techonology)),necessary_condition(pursue(advancements,renewable_energy_techonology),invest(solar_power_infrastructure))],is_necessary(invest(solar_power_infrastructure))
