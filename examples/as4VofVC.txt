Argumentation scheme: [has_property(Y, F), vague_for(F, PL), occurs_in(Y, context_that_requires(PL))], should_be_rejected(Y). Example 1: During a quarterly review, John submitted his market analysis report, which was filled with ambiguous descriptors without offering any concrete data. The ambiguity in his report fails to provide the clarity and precision required in high-stakes evaluations. Since the review process demands unambiguous and exact information, John's report should be rejected. [has_property(john_report, ambiguous_descriptors), vague_for(ambiguous_descriptors, clarity_precision), occurs_in(john_report, context_that_requires(clarity_precision))], should_be_rejected(john_report)
