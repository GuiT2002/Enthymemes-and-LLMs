Argumentation scheme: [adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P1, A)), adopt(X, opinion_respected_to(P2, B)), is_different(P1, P2),  is_similar(A,B)], is_using_double_standard(X). Example 1: At a literary roundtable, Julia insisted that all professional book critics must be strictly unbiased, yet when her own review was called into question for partiality, she simply shrugged it off. Since both situations concern the same standard of impartiality in reviewing, it's evident that Julia is applying a double standard. [adopt(julia, opinion_respected_to("demands strict impartiality", "professional book criticism")), adopt(julia, opinion_respected_to("dismisses bias concerns", "her own review")), is_different("demands strict impartiality", "dismisses bias concerns"), is_similar("professional book criticism", "her own review")], is_using_double_standard(julia)
