Argumentation scheme: [position_to_know(A,S),asserts(A,Ar),contain(S,Ar)],Ar. Example 1: Daniel is a meteorologist and claims that low pressure systems often bring stormy weather, so we can deduce that low pressure systems often bring stormy weather. [position_to_know(daniel,meteorology),asserts(daniel,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)),contain(meteorology,brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather))],brings(low_pressure_systems,stormy_weather)
